After finishing my university studies at [Bonn University](http://www.uni-bonn.de)
mid-2003 I very much was interested in continuing research in the area of
astro-physics, more specifically in radio-interferometry. The opportunity presented
itself in the form of a junior-researcher position at [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl),
the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. The institute just had received
major funding for the development and commissioning of the Low Frequency Array
([LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org)), a novel radio telescope to be constructed within
the Netherlands, with outriggers across other european countries.

My main involvement has been with the High-Energy Cosmic Rays Key Science Project,
based at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Whereas the main goal of our scientific
analysis is geared towards the understanding of the radio from extensive cosmic
ray air-showers, the incoming data almost are saturated with all sorts of signals
-- be they of natural or human-made origin; one of the topics I have been working
is the detection of radio signatures from electric discharges (lightnings) in
thunderstorms.
