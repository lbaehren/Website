## {title:} ##

**Fedora**, formerly **Fedora Core**, is an RPM-based, general purpose collection
of software, including an operating system based on the
[Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org), developed by the community-supported
[Fedora Project](http://www.fedoraproject.org) and owned by
[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com). The Fedora Project's mission is to lead
the advancement of free and open source software and content as a
collaborative community.

One of Fedora's main objectives is not only to contain software distributed under
a free and open source license, but also to be on the leading edge of such
technologies. Fedora developers prefer to make upstream changes instead of
applying fixes specifically for Fedoraâ€”this ensures that their updates are
available to all Linux distributions.

### Basic system setup ####

As it turns out a base installation comes with hardly any development tools installed,
hence in order to get a minimal setup run:

~~~~
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ boost-devel
sudo yum install git-svn cmake doxygen
~~~~

Add [RPM Fusion](http://rpmfusion.org) to the list of package repositories:

~~~~
sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
sudo yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm
~~~~

### Installation of extra packages ###

#### Amarok (with mp3 support) ####

Fedora package for Amarok media player:

~~~~
sudo yum install amarok
~~~~

For Amarok 2 using phonon-backend-xine:

~~~~
sudo yum install xine-lib-extras-freeworld
~~~~

For Amarok 2 using phonon-backend-gstreamer:

~~~~

#### VLC ####

[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player, which plays most of the multimedia files (MKV, AVI, MP4, etc.,). No codec packs needed to be installed, VLC is simple and powerfull multimedia player works on various Operating System Linux, Mac and Windows.
