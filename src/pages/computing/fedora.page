## {title:} ##

[Fedora](http://www.fedoraproject.org), formerly Fedora Core, is an RPM-based, general purpose collection of
software, including an operating system based on the Linux kernel, developed by
the community-supported Fedora Project and owned by Red Hat. The Fedora Project's
mission is to lead the advancement of free and open source software and content
as a collaborative community.

One of Fedora's main objectives is not only to contain software distributed under
a free and open source license, but also to be on the leading edge of such
technologies. Fedora developers prefer to make upstream changes instead of
applying fixes specifically for Fedoraâ€”this ensures that their updates are
available to all Linux distributions.
