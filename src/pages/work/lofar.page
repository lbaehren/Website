The [LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org) telescope, designed and built by [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl), is a revolutionary instrument able to detect radio waves with wavelengths up to 30-meter. Radio waves this long are typically generated by human activities as radio broadcasts, radar signals or satellite communications. They are also emitted by exotic objects in deep-space, such as accreting black holes, rotating neutron stars and supernovae. To detect these waves, LOFAR uses thousands of antennas spread all over Europe and combines the signals in a supercomputer located in the Netherlands. The 100 Gigabit per second of data flowing from all antennas are analyzed simultaneously and in real-time to provide the most detailed images ever done at these frequencies.

International LOFAR Telescope operations are coordinated by ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, on behalf of a consortium consisting of the Netherlands, Germany, France, the UK, and Sweden. Many of the technological solutions developed for LOFAR, in particular the calibration of phased-arrays as well as large-scale data transport and processing, will be highly relevant for future radio telescope projects such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
