## TROPOMI :: {title:} ##

Note: For some additional reading, also see the [blog entry](/blog/2014/2014-08/2014-08-26_20-24.html)
describing the process from the sketch on paper to the actually implemented version
as part of the TROPOMI software.

This has been one of the first times the quicklook routines have been applied
"in the wild".

The plot above represents the first working implementation, with all the sub-plots
in the correct positions and the track reconstruction routine applied to a simple
test dataset (elliptical sweep across the detector plane).

This is the original sketch with the basic idea for the various plots and their
arrangement on the page. After getting overlapping frames and the like a number
of times, I decided that it probably would be a good idea to step back from the
code at all for a while to address the layout first; once there would be
reasonably stable description of what exactly to plot and how to arrange the
individual plots, I could then go about implementing this.
