### AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.4D ###

_A fast, single-focal-length lens with normal picture angle (when attached to a
DX-format SLR, the picture angle is equivalent to a focal length of 75mm in
FX/35mm format)_

Probably __the__ advise when being asked which lens to get in addition to
whatever kit lens someone bought in combination with the camera. The 50mm range
might need some getting used to, as a lot of times you will need to zoom using
your feet, but for its conpact size this is a very versatile lens.

### AF Nikkor 85mm f/1.4D IF ###

_Fast and high-performance medium telephoto lens with maximum aperture of f/1.4_

The first fast lens I bought after running into trouble with the kit lens
available at the time.

### AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED ###

_High-power zoom lens with VR ll for exclusive use with Nikon digital SLRs_

As much as I like my fast lenses (f/2.8 or better), sometimes I simply want to
go light on the equipment I carry around with me; though at time I will pick up
the 50mm f/1.4 as the only glass to go in front of the camera, a bit more
flexibility in focal range is a nice thing to have. For a casual (photo-) walk
-- one camera, one lens -- with normal lighting conditions the 18-200mm is
a nice allround solution.

### AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G IF-ED ###

_Compact, lightweight G-type fast telephoto zoom lens with Vibration Reduction_
