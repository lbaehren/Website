### AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.4D ###

A fast, single-focal-length lens with normal picture angle (when attached to a
DX-format SLR, the picture angle is equivalent to a focal length of 75mm in
FX/35mm format)

Probably __the__ advise when being asked which lens to get in addition to
whatever kit lens someone bought in combination with the camera. The 50mm range
might need some getting used to, as a lot of times you will need to zoom using
your feet, but for its conpact size this is a very versatile lens.

### AF Nikkor 85mm f/1.4D IF ###

Fast and high-performance medium telephoto lens with maximum aperture of f/1.4

The first fast lens I bought after running into trouble with the kit lens
available at the time.
