If you want to learn more about lens choices given to you by the various manifacturers, have a look at the following pages:

### AF Nikkor 50mm f/1.4D ###

_A fast, single-focal-length lens with normal picture angle (when attached to a
DX-format SLR, the picture angle is equivalent to a focal length of 75mm in
FX/35mm format)_

Probably __the__ advise when being asked which lens to get in addition to
whatever kit lens someone bought in combination with the camera. The 50mm range
might need some getting used to, as a lot of times you will need to zoom using
your feet, but for its conpact size this is a very versatile lens.

### AF Nikkor 85mm f/1.4D IF ###

_Fast and high-performance medium telephoto lens with maximum aperture of f/1.4_

![AF Nikkor 85mm f/1.4D IF](/photography/lenses/nikkor_af_85mm_f-1.4d.jpg)

The first fast lens I bought after running into trouble with the kit lens
available at the time.

### Tamron SP AF10-24mm F/3.5-4.5 Di II LD Aspherical IF ###

_Wider and longer than others in its class, this compact, lightweight, high-performance lens for DSLRs with APS-C size sensors provides 35mm equivalent coverage from 16mm ultra-wide to 37mm semi-wide, a remarkable 2.4X zoom ratio. With a maximum coverage of over 108°, this state-of-the-art classic is the perfect solution for expanding your visual horizons._

### AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED ###

_11x zoom with VR image stabilization, designed exclusively for use with Nikon’s DX-format, and makes for a perfect one-lens solution._

As much as I like my fast lenses (f/2.8 or better), sometimes I simply want to
go light on the equipment I carry around with me; though at time I will pick up
the 50mm f/1.4 as the only glass to go in front of the camera, a bit more
flexibility in focal range is a nice thing to have. For a casual (photo-) walk
-- one camera, one lens -- with normal lighting conditions the 18-200mm is
a nice allround solution.

### AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G IF-ED ###

_Compact, lightweight G-type fast telephoto zoom lens with Vibration Reduction_

### Nikkor 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6D ED ###

_Compact, lightweight telephoto zoom lens with Vibration Reduction_

### Sigma 105mm F2.8 EX DG OS HSM ###

_This large aperture medium telephoto macro lens offers advanced performance of close-up photography. Sigma’s own proprietary OS (Optical Stabilizer) system enables handheld close-up photography. A Special Low Dispersion (SLD) lens and one high refractive index SLD lens provide excellent correction for all types of aberration and distortion. A floating focusing system moves two different lens groups in the optical path to different positions. This system compensates for astigmatic aberration and spherical aberration and provides extremely high optical performance from infinity to 1:1 Macro._
