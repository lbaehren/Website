# Photography :: Licensing schemes #

I like the idea of keeping the threshold as low as possible; because of this I am distributing my images under a [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/legalcode), which essentially means that pictures can be used for non-commercial purposes, as long as proper credits are given.

The following rights usage information is embedded as part of an images' IPTC information:

> This work is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) License. For details see creativecommons.org

### Creative Commons License ###

With Creative Commons you are free:

 * __To Share__ -- Copy, Distribute, and Transmit the image
 * __To Remix__ -- Create Derivative works of the image

Under these conditions:

 * __Attribution__ -- Attribution to Lars Baehren must be made along with the image.
 * __Non-Commercial__ -- The image must not be used for commercial purposes under any circumstances. For clarity on what defines commercial use, please see the Sample Accepted Uses below.
 * __Share Alike__ -- If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the same or similar license to this one.

Sample accepted use of the Creative Commons License:

 - Blog Post describing a visit to a concert or festival.
 - Online article discussing the growing popularity of HDR photography.
 - A website for a school project about the use of light in art.
 - An individual using an image as a desktop background for the computer monitor.

__Licensing fee:__ Given the above conditions no licensing fee will incur for the usage of my images. You are however invited to show your appreciation by a donation at your sole discretion ("Pay what you want"), leaving your fair share to support my photographic work.

### License to Copyright ###

'Commercial Use' regarding the use of images online or offline is defined very broadly. The determination of commercial or non-commercial use is based on the contextual use of the image. The determination is NOT based on the tax-filing status of the entity using the image nor on whether or not a financial transaction takes place.

Commercial use of my images is allowed only if expressly granted. All commercial uses will incur a licensing fee. Fees are based on the following criteria:

 - Media – print, web, television, etc.
 - Distribution Size – number of copies printed, viewing audience size, exposure (regional, national, international)
 - Length of Use – 1 year, 2 years, etc.
 - Prominence of Display – 1/4 page, 1/2 page, full page, spread, front cover, back cover, home page (online), interior page (online), etc.


### License design and rationale ###

All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. Every license helps creators — we call them licensors if they use our tools — retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work — at least non-commercially. Every Creative Commons license also ensures licensors get the credit for their work they deserve. Every Creative Commons license works around the world and lasts as long as applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright). These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors can choose to grant additional permissions when deciding how they want their work to be used.

A Creative Commons licensor answers a few simple questions on the path to choosing a license — first, do I want to allow commercial use or not, and then second, do I want to allow derivative works or not? If a licensor decides to allow derivative works, she may also choose to require that anyone who uses the work -- we call them licensees -- to make that new work available under the same license terms. We call this idea "ShareAlike" and it is one of the mechanisms that (if chosen) helps the digital commons grow over time. ShareAlike is inspired by the GNU General Public License, used by many free and open source software projects.
