### Rheinkultur 2008 

_05 June 2008, Rheinaue, Bonn, Germany_

Another splendid issue, the 26th, of the open-air festival with free entrance and a wide variety of music: Ben Folds, The Futureheads, Anti-Flag, Sportfreunde Stiller, Air Traffic, Tomte, Schandmaul, Blackmail, ... Except for the evening the weather was just great, just the thing for an open-air festival; on the other hand long-time visitors of the festival know how to prepare, so the weather most likely is not going to be the all-deciding factor. After years of of taking pictures just for fund and for myself, this year I received an accreditation through Heavy Metal Magazine, such that bringing along all the photography gear was no problem at all.
