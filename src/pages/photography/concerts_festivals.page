### Wacken Open Air Festival 2008 ###

_Thu, 31 Jul – Sat, 02 Aug 2008, Wacken, Germany_

Just when I thought that the Graspop Metal Meeting was impressive... The Wacken Open Air is of a scale which is hard to believe and explain to a person who has not been there and seen it. Wacken – a small municipality near the city of Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, with approx. 2000 inhabitants – for the extended weekend once more has been taken over by literally tens of thousands of metal fans from all over the world.

One of the biggest obstacles this time (as compared the GMM) was the fact that the access to the photographers pit was handled very restrictively; as a consequence all the pictures had to be taken from some vantage point in the audience, signifying a considerably larger distance to the artists on stage and a constant struggle with someone getting into the line of sight.

### Rheinkultur 2008 

_05 June 2008, Rheinaue, Bonn, Germany_

Another splendid issue, the 26th, of the open-air festival with free entrance and a wide variety of music: Ben Folds, The Futureheads, Anti-Flag, Sportfreunde Stiller, Air Traffic, Tomte, Schandmaul, Blackmail, ... Except for the evening the weather was just great, just the thing for an open-air festival; on the other hand long-time visitors of the festival know how to prepare, so the weather most likely is not going to be the all-deciding factor. After years of of taking pictures just for fund and for myself, this year I received an accreditation through Heavy Metal Magazine, such that bringing along all the photography gear was no problem at all.

### Graspop Metal Meeting 2008 

_27.-29. June 2008, Dessel, Belgium_

Three days outside with a few thousand metal fans to see acts such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica, Whitesnake, Iced Earth, Yngwie Malmsteen & a lot more; check out the festival website for further details. This was my first big assignment for the Heavy Metal Magazin, covering both most of the concerts as well providing material on the festival ground as such. Had a lot of fun and came back with almost 3500 exposed frames. A great experience, especially working side by side with a number of people who do this for a living; turns out we all have our problems when it comes to getting usable pictures under opposing circumstances.
