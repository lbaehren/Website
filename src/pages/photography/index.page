Even though having held one or the other smaller camera in my hand before, I still consider 1992 as kind of a starting point for getting a bit more serious about photography. About to go onto a highly anticipated trip to Spain, I started to investigate options how to better capture some of the expected impressions in pictures; given the considerations the decision to buy my first SLR only seemed logical. The Nikon F601 remained a trusted companion for more than 15 years, helping me to form my first ideas about the type of pictures I might be interested in. As a consequence of this initial learning process it became obvious pretty soon, that in order to get closer to the results I was aiming at, a lens of considerable longer range was required -- adding a Sigma 70-300mm to my bag therefore was a logical step. 

Using this combination I started heading into the direction which ultimately would also lead to the switch from analog to digital photography: a long-time fan of the Rheinkultur music festival -- taking place in Bonn (DE) during the first weekend of July -- I began combining my love for music with the fascination of observing musicians during their performance.

### Digital photography

Why did I switch to digital photography? There may have been a number of arguments which formed the decision, but what finally tipped the balance was the really unique feature: instantaneous feedback.

Even with the incredible sharp glass I have been adding to my lens collection, I have been longing for possibilities to extend my capabilities to operate in a low-light environment. So when Nikon announced the release of their new D3 and D300 camera in fall 2007, I was hooked instantaneously. Slightly intimidated by the top-of-the-line flagship I opted for the D300 â€“ a spur-of-the-moment purchase while on a visit back in Germany.
