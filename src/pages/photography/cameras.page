### Nikon D300 ###

When released, the [Nikon D300](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d300) quickly
turned out to be more but an incremental upgrade to the widely popular D200.

### Nikon D3 ###

The [Nikon D3](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d3) is an amazing camera. When
released it was widely considered as Nikon's catching up and even overtaking Canon's
line of processional cameras. While its smaller cousin (the D300) shared many of its
general features the D3 undoubtably was constructed to take the beating of
everyday professional usage.

### Nikon D80 ###

The [Nikon D80](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d80) was point of entry into DSLR
photography. It served me well or the time I owned it, introducing me to the notion
that the camera body typically is less of a long-term investment than the glass to
along with it (and subsequently other camera bodies).
