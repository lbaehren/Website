### Tutorials ###

  * [HDR Software overview](http://wiki.panotools.org/HDR_Software_overview)
  * The [HDR Cookbook](http://farbspiel-photo.com/learn/hdr-cookbook) (Author: Klaus Hermann) is a free collection of practical, in-depth tutorials on High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography and some variants like HDR Panorama and Vertorama photography. It extends far beyond the contents of many websites and books on this subject by giving hands-on information on professional shooting and post-processing techniques.
  * [HDR for the Rest of Us](http://www.dpreview.com/articles/1944596440/hdr-for-the-rest-of-us) (Author:  Rick Sammon) Most of us think of HDR images as surreal creations that bear little resemblance to the 'real' world. Rick Sammon shows how it is possible to reap the benefits of capturing an extended dynamic range in a more natural-looking image.

### Software ###

  * [Luminance HDR](http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net) is an open source graphical user interface application that aims to provide a workflow for HDR imaging.
