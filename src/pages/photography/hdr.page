### Workflow ###

Camera setup:

  - Set camera to RAW modus.
  - Clean lens and image sensor. This is even more important with HDR than with 'normal' images, as due to the enhanced contrast range the dust specs show up more prominently.
  - Take dust reference photo, for later substraction.
  - Activate shutter delay, to reduce vibrations originating from flipping mirror.
  - Set Picture control to a neutral setting. (Nikon)
  - Set autobracketing, typically 5 steps with -2, -1, 0, +1, +2 EV.
  - Activate _Interval timer shooting_ with 5 frames per instance.

RAW processing:

  - Set Picture control to a neutral setting, if not done in camera.
  - Correction for chromatic aberration.
  - Substraction of dust reference picture.
  - Export images as 16bit TIFF.
