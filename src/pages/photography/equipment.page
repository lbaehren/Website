I never have been hosting much of an illusion that the mere purchase of more expensive and advanced equipment would automatically improve my pictures… or even make me a better photographer. Of course I would be lying if I were to pretend equipment had no effect at all – what point would there be in buy it then? – but then main thing this has been doing for me is to extend my choice of options. If you were to spend some time going through the countless books, articles, web-pages, etc. on photography, you would be encountering various attempts to draw comparisons with other creative processes, such as painting, writing or playing music. Even though – as it always will be the case with analogues and comparisons

### ... and why... ###

Even though having held one or the other smaller camera in my hand before, I still consider 1992 as kind of a starting point for getting a bit more serious about photography. About to go onto a highly anticipated trip to Spain, I started to investigate options how to better capture some of the expected impressions in pictures; given the considerations the decision to buy my first SLR only seemed logical. The Nikon F601 remained a trusted companion for more than 15 years, helping me to form my first ideas about the type of pictures I might be interested in. As a consequence of this initial learning process it became obvious pretty soon, that in order to get closer to the results I was aiming at, a lens of considerable longer range was required -- adding a Sigma 70-300mm to my bag therefore was a logical step. This combination stayed with me for quite a while until end of 2006 I finally changed to digital - buying a Nikon D80.

Starting from summer 2007 I have been getting more and more serious in my approach, especially because I wanted to get closer to the type of results I wanted to achieve. The break-point was when starting to expand on the lens collection, to cover a wider range of light conditions:
