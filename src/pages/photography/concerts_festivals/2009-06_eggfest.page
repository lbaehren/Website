## Eggfest 2009 ##

_06 Jun 2009, Eibergen, Netherlands_

While everyone already has his/her eyes on the big open-air festival of the summer – such as e.g. the Graspop Metal Meeting or the Wacken Open Air – there are of course quite a number of smaller festivals all over the country. It was through Izegrim that I took notice of the Eggfest, a small but very nice festival in the town of Eibergen. Hard to find on the map, it however turned out worth the travel, as the festival provides a very relaxed atmosphere where music fans an musicians can interact. Noteworthy is the fact, that the festival takes place at the Eibergen Open-Air Theater, a nice located between border of the city and the river – plans are under way to renovate the location, which would make it all the more interesting to visit in the future.
