_03.-05. Oct 2008, Baarlo, Netherlands_

The 10th edition in total – the first one for me – featured [Pagan's Mind](http://www.pagansmind.com), Cynic and [Threshold](http://www.thresh.net) as headliners. Held at the Sjiwa in Baarlo, the festival brought together an international cast of bands and fans; or a number of the bands this was their first trip to Europe ever – so yes, there were quite a number of specials. Limiting the total number of participants – bands, fans, press, etc. – to approx. 500 persons, resulted in a very related atmosphere, which left ample room for conversations and meetings. While I already had seen Threshold and Cynic live on stage earlier this year, most of the other bands were either completely new to me or on the “still have to see” list.
