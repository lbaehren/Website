_27.-29. June 2008, Dessel, Belgium_

Three days outside with a few thousand metal fans to see acts such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica, Whitesnake, Iced Earth, Yngwie Malmsteen & a lot more; check out the festival website for further details. This was my first big assignment for the Heavy Metal Magazin, covering both most of the concerts as well providing material on the festival ground as such. Had a lot of fun and came back with almost 3500 exposed frames. A great experience, especially working side by side with a number of people who do this for a living; turns out we all have our problems when it comes to getting usable pictures under opposing circumstances.
