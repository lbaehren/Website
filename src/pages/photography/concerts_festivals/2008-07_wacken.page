_Thu, 31 Jul – Sat, 02 Aug 2008, Wacken, Germany_

Just when I thought that the Graspop Metal Meeting was impressive... The Wacken Open Air is of a scale which is hard to believe and explain to a person who has not been there and seen it. Wacken – a small municipality near the city of Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, with approx. 2000 inhabitants – for the extended weekend once more has been taken over by literally tens of thousands of metal fans from all over the world.

One of the biggest obstacles this time (as compared the GMM) was the fact that the access to the photographers pit was handled very restrictively; as a consequence all the pictures had to be taken from some vantage point in the audience, signifying a considerably larger distance to the artists on stage and a constant struggle with someone getting into the line of sight.
