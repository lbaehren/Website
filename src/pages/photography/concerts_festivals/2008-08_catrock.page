_Sat, 16 Aug 2008, Emlichheim, Germany_

With two weeks rest from the W:O:A it was time to pack up gear and head out for the next open-air festival. Cat-Rock was held at Emlichheim (DE), just a few kilometers into Germany and reasonably well to reach by bike from the nearest train station on the dutch side. The festival started at 10:00 h in the morning and ran until somewhat after midnight. Playing as opening act were the friends from Non-Divine (who also originally pointed me to the event), followed by a number of bands I either had never heard of before or was aware of only vaguely by name. Exciting for me of course was possibility to have another encounter with swedish power-metal heroes Sabaton; sadly enough their set had to be cut down by at least 10 minutes due to some hick-up in the overall schedule.
