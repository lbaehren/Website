# Software Development #

**:::**

### Personal background

Between January 2004 and October 2010 my work has been focussing on the development
of software for the scientific analysis of the data taken with the LOFAR telescope.
During the first phase of that period my primary interest has been in the imaging
of the radio intensity distribution as emitted by cosmic ray air-shower -- but
also as originating from lightning discharges in thunderstorms. The novel
capabilities of “digital radio-telescopes” -- the usage of large numbers of cheap
receptor elements combined with high-performance computing -- allows to explore
physical processes in unprecedented ways.

### Projects

 - The [Data Access Library](/development/projects/dal.html) (DAL) is a library
   that abstracts the underlying file format from the user when working with
   radio astronomy data. Underlying formats may include HDF5, AIPS++/CASA
   tables, FITS or specific raw formats. This library is available to both the
   C/C++ developer and the Python user via the "pydal" module.

 - [prometheus-sumo](/development/projects/prometheus-sumo.html) is a simple
   (almost) virtual package, to ease the retrieval of the various components in
   the software stack for "[prometheus](/work/prometheus.html) -- The
   Distributed Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies".
