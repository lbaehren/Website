## {title:} ##

The [Data Access Library](https://github.com/nextgen-astrodata/DAL) (DAL) is a library that abstracts the underlying file format from the user when working with radio astronomy data. Underlying formats may include HDF5, AIPS++/CASA tables, FITS or specific raw formats. This library is available to both the C/C++ developer and the Python user via the "pydal" module.

### Background ##

The size and complexity of astronomical data are growing at relentless rates. This increase is especially apparent in the radio community as evidenced by the data challenges faced by many of the SKA pathfinders and other major radio telescopes such as [LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org), [EVLA](http://science.nrao.edu/evla), [ALMA](http://science.nrao.edu/alma), ASKAP, MeerKAT, MWA, LWA and eMERLIN. Enormous data rates are also becoming a challenge for large optical projects that are currently ramping up including [Pan-Starrs](http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu) and [LSST](http://www.lsst.org). As progress towards meeting these challenges, ASTRON and the LOFAR project are currently exploring the use of the Hierarchical Data Format, version 5 (HDF5) for LOFAR radio data encapsulation.

Officially, the DAL supports three file types:

- **Hierarchical Data Format Version 5** (HDF5), is a relatively recent format designed with particular attention to efficient operation on extremely large data sets.  HDF5 is the intended format for LOFAR data products. HDF5 is organized much like a unix file system.  The internal structure consists of a root group, '/', which may recursively contain subgroups.  Each of these groups may, in turn, contain other groups or n-dimensional arrays of simple or complex datatypes.  HDF5 tables are particular case of a HDF5 array and thus are treated in a similar manner.  Almost all objects in a HDF5 file can hold associated metadata in the form of an attribute. HDF5 files can be both read and written by the DAL.

- **CASA Tables** in general, and Measurement Sets in particular, are the primary data product of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).  As WSRT is also based at ASTRON (where there is a large community of experienced CASA users), there is naturally a strong interest and advantage in building upon this expertise for LOFAR. CASA tables can currently be read, but not written, by the DAL.

- **FITS** is the standard astronomical image format. Among its advantages for inclusion in the DAL is its widespread use and extensive toolset. Among its limitations is the fact that it was not designed for large and complex datasets. FITS is the lowest of priority of the three supported formats and currently has almost no actual support in the DAL.
