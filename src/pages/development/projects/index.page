## Development projects ##

 - The [Data Access Library](projects/dal.html) (DAL) is a library that abstracts the underlying file format from the user when working with radio astronomy data. Underlying formats may include HDF5, AIPS++/CASA tables, FITS or specific raw formats. This library is available to both the C/C++ developer and the Python user via the "pydal" module.

 - [prometheus-sumo](projects/prometheus-sumo.html) is a simple (almost) virtual package, to ease the retrieval of the various components in the software stack for "[prometheus](/work/prometheus.html) -- The Distributed Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies".
