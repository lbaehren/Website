### Overview

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) is an extensible, open-source system that manages
the build process in an operating system and compiler independent manner. Unlike
many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the
native build environment. Simple configuration files placed in each source
directory (called `CMakeLists.txt` files) are used to generate standard build
files (e.g., `makefiles` on Unix and projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) which
are used in the usual way. CMake can compile source code, create libraries, generate
wrappers, and build executables in arbitrary combinations. CMake supports
in-place and out-of-place builds, and can therefore support multiple builds from
a single source tree. CMake also supports static and dynamic library builds.
Another nice feature of CMake is that it generates a cache file that is designed
to be used with a graphical editor. For example, when CMake runs, it locates
include files, libraries, and executable, and may encounter optional build
directives. This information is gathered into the cache, which may be changed
by the user prior to the generation of the native build files.

CMake is designed to support complex directory hierarchies and applications
dependent on several libraries. For example, CMake supports projects consisting
of multiple toolkits (i.e., libraries), where each toolkit might contain several
directories, and the application depends on the toolkits plus additional code.
CMake can also handle situations where executables must be built in order to
generate code that is then compiled and linked into a final application. Because
CMake is open source, and has a simple, extensible design, CMake can be extended
as necessary to support new features.

### Usage

Using CMake is simple. The build process is controlled by creating one or more
``CMakeLists.txt`` files in each directory (including subdirectories) that make up
a project. Each ``CMakeLists.txt`` consists of one or more commands. Each command
has the form

~~~~
COMMAND (args...)
~~~~

where ``COMMAND`` is the name of the command, and args is a white-space separated
list of arguments. CMake provides many pre-defined commands, but if you need to,
you can add your own commands. In addition, the advanced user can add other
makefile generators for a particular compiler/OS combination. (While Unix and MSVC++
is supported currently, other developers are adding other compiler/OS support.)

### CMake modules

Having worked with __CMake__ for a number of years, I have been enjoying the growing
functionality of the ecosystem surrounding the cross-platform Makefile generator.
However, mainly coming from an astronomy background, more but once I ran into the
issue of missing search scripts for domain-specific packages (such as e.g. CFITSIO
or WCSLIB), thereby starting to write them myself. As a result of this over time
I have been accumulating a number of search modules, which not only I started
moving around between different software projects, but which also might be useful
to a wider audience.

The collection of CMake find scripts can be obtained from Github via:
