### Summary ###

Typically the main components of an external package - such as e.g. an
external library -- of interest are the header file(s) (i.e. the path to have them
included into your source code) and the library file(s) used during linking.
However properties of packages change, such that the dependency needs to be
expressed more specifically w.r.t. a certain version.

### Description ###

~~~~
 <package>_VERSION       = full provided version string
 <package>_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
 <package>_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
 <package>_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
~~~~

Here is a simple test program which will call the underlying library and then output
the version information found therein:

~~~~
#include <H5public.h>
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
    std::cout << H5_VERS_MAJOR << ";" << H5_VERS_MINOR << ";" << H5_VERS_RELEASE;
    return 0;
}
~~~~

The following instructions are used in the corresponding [CMake](/development/tools/cmake.html) module, to build and run the above test program, as well as capturing its output.

~~~~
 if (HDF5_HDF5_LIBRARY AND HDF5_INCLUDES)

     find_file (TestVersionHDF5 TestVersionHDF5.cc
         HINTS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}
         )

     try_run (
         HDF5_VERSION_RUN_RESULT_VAR
         HDF5_VERSION_COMPILE_RESULT_VAR
         ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} ${TestVersionHDF5}
         CMAKE_FLAGS -DINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES=${HDF5_INCLUDES} -DLINK_LIBRARIES=${HDF5_HDF5_LIBRARY}
         RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE HDF5_VERSION
         )

     if (HDF5_VERSION)
         ## extract partial version numbers
         list (GET HDF5_VERSION 0 HDF5_VERSION_MAJOR)
         list (GET HDF5_VERSION 1 HDF5_VERSION_MINOR)
         list (GET HDF5_VERSION 2 HDF5_VERSION_PATCH)
         ## assemble full version number
         set (HDF5_VERSION "${HDF5_VERSION_MAJOR}.${HDF5_VERSION_MINOR}.${HDF5_VERSION_PATCH}")
     endif (HDF5_VERSION)

 endif (HDF5_HDF5_LIBRARY AND HDF5_INCLUDES)
