It always comes down to the same thing: if there s something you need to do over
and over again, then probabaly it is a good idea to script and automatize it.
This very general rule can be applied to almost everything, e.g. to the
generation of documents from their LaTeX sources.

> In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values
> `${ARGC}` which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function
> as well as `${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ...` which will have the actual values of
> the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional
> arguments. Additionally `${ARGV}` holds the list of all arguments given to the
> macro and `${ARGN}` holds the list of arguments past the last expected argument.

~~~~ cmake
macro (add_latex_documents)

    set (_upstreamTarget ${ARGV0})

    ## Get list of LaTeX source files within the directory
    file (GLOB _sources *.tex)

    foreach (_source ${_sources})
        get_filename_component(_sourceName ${_source} NAME_WE)
        if (_upstreamTarget)
            add_latex_document (${_source} ${_upstreamTarget})
        else (_upstreamTarget)
            add_latex_document (${_source})
        endif (_upstreamTarget)
    endforeach (_source)

endmacro (add_latex_documents)
