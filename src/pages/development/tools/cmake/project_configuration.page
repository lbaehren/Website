## CMake :: {title:} ##

Using CMake is simple. The build process is controlled by creating one or more
`CMakeLists.txt` files in each directory (including subdirectories) that make up
a project. Each `CMakeLists.txt` consists of one or more commands. Each command
has the form `COMMAND (argsâ€¦)` where `COMMAND` is the name of the command, and
`args` is a white-space separated list of arguments. CMake provides many
pre-defined commands, but if you need to, you can add your own commands.

`-- src
~~~~

The first entries in the `CMakeLists.txt` file will be used for book-keeping and
basic version checking:

~~~~ cmake
## Name of the project handled by CMake
project (Bibliotheque)

## Minimum required version of CMake to configure the project
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8)

## Enforced CMake policy
cmake_policy (VERSION 2.8)
