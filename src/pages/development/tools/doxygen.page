## {title:} ##

[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) is a documentation generator, a tool for writing software reference documentation. The documentation is written within code, and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.

Doxygen supports multiple programming languages, especially C++, C, C#, Objective-C, Java, Python, IDL, VHDL, Fortran and PHP. Doxygen is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
