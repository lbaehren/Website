## {title:}

Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on being fast. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development.

Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

Git's current software maintenance is overseen by Junio Hamano. Distributed under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License, git is free software.
