For years Pine was THE program used to read email on a Unix system. The Pico text editor is 
the portion of the program one would use to compose his or her mail messages. Many beginners 
to Unix flocked to Pico and Pine because of their well organized, easy to use interfaces. 
With the proliferation of GNU/Linux in the mid to late 90's, many University students became 
intimately familiar with the strengths (and weaknesses) of Pine and Pico.

The [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org) distribution, known for its strict standards 
in distributing truly "free" software (i.e. software with no restrictions on redistribution), would not include a 
binary package for Pine or Pico. Many people had a serious dilemma: they loved these 
programs, but the versions available at the time were not truly free software in the GNU 
sense of the word.
