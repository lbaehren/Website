## webgen

.. is a tool for the generation of static websites -- such as the ones you are
looking at right now.

### Introduction

When webgen is run it combines the template with each of the page files and
generates the HTML output files. During this process special tags are substituted
so that, for example, a menu is generated. Actually, this website was generated
with webgen and, for example, the menu that you can see was created dynamically.

### Creating a new website

Creating a new website ist rather straight forward:

~~~~
webgen create www.mysite.com
~~~~

The resulting directory structure -- including configuration and control files --
will look something like this:

~~~~
www.mysite.com/
├── README
├── Rakefile
├── config.yaml
├── ext
│   └── init.rb
├── src
│   ├── browserfix.css
│   ├── default.css
│   ├── default.template
│   ├── images
│   ├── index.page
├── webgen.cache
└── website
~~~~
