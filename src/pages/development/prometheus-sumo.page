**prometheus-sumo** is a simple (almost) virtual package, to ease the retrieval of the various components in the software stack for "[prometheus](/work/prometheus.html) -- The Distributed Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies".

### Getting the source code

The source for prometheus-sumo is hosted on Github at; go there to read about the various options to retrieve a working copy of the code. In the simplest case, were you need a read-only copy, simply run

~~~~
git clone git://github.com/lbaehren/prometheus-sumo.git
~~~~

in order to to clone into a local working copy. 

In order to now configure and build the project "out of source" -- hence keeping your options open to cleanly remove intermediate/temporary files -- create a separate build directory from within to continue:

~~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
~~~~
