## Development Tools ##

**:::**

### ... for documentation generation

 - [Doxygen](doxygen/index.html) is a documentation generator, a tool for writing software reference documentation. The documentation is written within code, and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.

### ... for version control

 - [Git](http://git-scm.com) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

### ... for editing

Wikipedia has a nice article providing [basic comparisons for common text editors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors).

#### nano

For years Pine was THE program used to read email on a Unix system. The Pico text editor is
the portion of the program one would use to compose his or her mail messages. Many beginners
to Unix flocked to Pico and Pine because of their well organized, easy to use interfaces.
With the proliferation of GNU/Linux in the mid to late 90's, many University students became
intimately familiar with the strengths (and weaknesses) of Pine and Pico.

The [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org) distribution, known for its strict standards
in distributing truly "free" software (i.e. software with no restrictions on redistribution), would not include a
binary package for Pine or Pico. Many people had a serious dilemma: they loved these
programs, but the versions available at the time were not truly free software in the GNU
sense of the word.

#### Aquamacs

Aquamacs is an Aqua-native build of the powerful Emacs text editor. By "Aqua-native,"
we mean more than just the fact that this version of Emacs runs as a standard OS X
application.  Aquamacs features extensive customization: it will feel and behave mostly
like an Aqua program - while still being a real GNU Emacs with all the ergonomy and
extensibility you've come to expect from this world-class editor. It's beeen adapted
by David Reitter, based on GNU Emacs by Richard Stallman and many others.
