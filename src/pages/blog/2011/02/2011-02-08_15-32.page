It has been quite a remarkable discovery a while ago: finish symphonic power-metal act [Amberian Dawn](http://www.last.fm/music/Amberian+Dawn) popped up under radar a bit out of nowhere.

> Amberian Dawn is a symphonic power metal band that formed in 2006 in Finland. Their music combines melodic, dramatic and powerful metal with female soprano vocals. The band currently consists of Heidi Parviainen (vocals), Tuomas Seppälä (keyboards, guitar), Kimmo Korhonen (guitar), Kasperi Heikkinen (guitar), Jukka Koskinen (bass), and Heikki Saari (drums).

After being fairly impressed by the band's debut album [River of Tuoni](http://www.last.fm/music/Amberian+Dawn/River+of+Tuoni) I always felt that there should be more. Well, as it turns out there actually is -- which tells me that I need to be a bit more thorough when it comes to doing my homework -- only I was not aware of it... until today. While on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) chasing down band connections originating from [Time Requiem](http://www.last.fmhttp://www.last.fm/music/Time+Requiem), I once more encountered the name of [Anubis Gate](http://www.last.fm/music/Anubis+Gate); following up on this I all of a sudden seemed to have stepped into a whole new arena of names, I never even had heard of before (I think there's another report to be marked down here, because this will be very interesting). However not all of the cross-connections were completely new, but also a few known names showed up as well; just to make sure I was not missing out on something I ran another check on them as well -- which then pointed me to at least one more _Amberian Dawn_ I hadn't heard of yet... unacceptable of course.

From what I have been listening to so far -- I only made it to track four right now -- I am fairly impressed; for some reason Finland was and still remains the homeland for this type of music.
