Looks like the [line-up for the 6th edition](http://www.last.fm/festival/1777862+6.+Night+of+the+Prog) is coming along; when we were checking on this about a week ago only a single band was lists, namely [Eloy](http://www.last.fm/music/Eloy). However within the last few day two other very interesting acts have been joining the list:

> We are proud to announce German Prog Legend ELOY to perform their first show within 12 years on friday, July 8th. [IQ](http://www.last.fm/music/IQ) and [Riverside](http://www.last.fm/music/Riverside) are confirmed to the Festival as well. We are negotiating with a lot of bands and hope to confirm very soon some more names.

While this just by itself already looks very tempting, of there is still the question whether or not [Gazpacho](http://www.last.fm/music/Gazpacho) will make an appearance as well; given the fact that the current _Missa Atropos Tour_ only had a few dates and has ended last week -- which is hardly enough to keep fans happy -- I am speculating on the band showing up a at least a few progressive festivals.
