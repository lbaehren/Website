Does not happen too often, that we have special guests at [Whisky break](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157616922013059); however this time around we had [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl)'s very own [Mike Garrett](https://twitter.com/#!/ASTRON_LOFAR) joining us for our Friday afternoon extravaganza of fine Whisky.

Though starting quite early this time around -- also because Mike was here at the API as speaker for the afternoon colloquium -- we spend enough time to finish the quite tasty Whisky brought in by Daniela. Surely a fun time and nice way to round up the week at the institute.
