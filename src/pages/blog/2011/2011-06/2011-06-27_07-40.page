Want to see our british collegues all dressed up in front of the camera, trying to explain selected aspects of LOFAR to the non-expert audience? Then you probably should got to [CNN's Motherboard-TV](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/06/02/motherboard.lofar/index.html) and have a look at [the story available](http://motherboard.tv/2011/6/2/motherboard-tv-the-biggest-telescope-on-earth--2) there:

> From a quiet swath of English countryside, some one and a half hours outside of London, researchers are receiving radio messages from the farthest reaches of the universe.
>
> To do it, they're relying on one of astronomy's newest and largest gadgets -- the [Low Frequency Radio Array radio telescope](http://www.lofar.org). The new, clever Dutch and EU-wide installation uses 15,000 low-tech receivers, supercomputer data processing and high-speed internet to form a mega-telescope capable of absorbing cosmic radio waves from the full sky at higher resolutions than ever before. When the British section of the telescope opened late last year, Motherboard attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony and met some of the scientists involved.

The opening ceremony referred to here is the opening of the Chilbolton station, an event which attracted a lot of players within the LOFAR project. While a number of shorter video bits have been circulated through the LOFAR-UK website already, finding this report took a bit longer (is now was mentioned in an email sent around by ASTRON); most prominently it features Rob and Aris trying to explain the multi-beam capabilities of LOFAR, as well as the backend to carry out pulsar observations. Of course some of the fun of watching this short piece, is seeing several well known figures, all dressed up, marching around in the field within which the station is located; so besides the scientific contents there always is a certain entertaining factor in it.
