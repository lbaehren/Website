Have a few email conversations going on how to the required automated test build up and running -- apart from this I am going into seclusion mode to get some coding work done. A bit frustrating that people keep shouting, but not providing any usable feedback to work with; can't wait until everybody is coming around, so I am just pushing ahead to things going at least on my end.
