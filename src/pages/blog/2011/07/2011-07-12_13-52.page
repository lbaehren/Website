... there now is a way to actually see it. I just finished an experimental build
of the DAL, containing the latest set of changes for the ''dalDataset'' to take
into account I/O mode flags and carrying along internal parameters. As soon as
the results from the test build hit the
[Dashboard](http://svn.astron.nl/CDash/index.php?project=DAL) I went there to
have a look how I was doing; as it turns out the changes I have been working on
this morning have caused some of the previously successful tests to fail.
However the problem in the past typically was such, that one would well be able
to see from the summary that an increased number of test failed, but figuring
out which ones as not straight forward. Well, looks like the recent update to
the Dashboard server has brought quite an improvement:

![DAL Dashboard](/blog/2011/07/2011-07-12_dal_dashboard.png)

Tests, which were successful beforehand, but got broken since the last experimental build, now are marked with a red flag, thereby making it easy to locate them.
