There has been some back and forth for a while now, considering the question why certain functionality would be available or not on certain systems. More precisely: depending on the operating system and the version of some of the external libraries used by the DAL, certain portions of the code would build or not. 

The latest issue in this stream of problems is to understand why some of the code using the the Boost C++ library will not compile on the lfe001 front-end node of the CEP1 cluster. After going back and forth over this I am very much inclined to believe, that this is something related to version of Boost++ installed on the system: comparing results from builds on other -- more up-to-date -- Linux systems th only main difference I am able to detect is that the cluster is using a fairly old version of the library. However -- at least to my best knowledge -- nobody has ever tried to go through the motions of really testing the various versions of Boost++, in order to determine which features are supported by which version of the library.

Enter my side project while working on the presentation for today's Pizza Lunch Talk: I have been downloading sources for all Boost libraries release 1.34.0 to the most recent 1.46.1, in order to build and install them on my machine, such that I have them at my disposal. But since building Boost++ takes a bit of time (and here this being multiplied by the number of library versions), my laptop has been busy compiling last night, now providing me with a nice collection of installations I can use for testing:

Just need to get done with the lunch talk, then I can get back to this, to get some proper answers of what is going on.
