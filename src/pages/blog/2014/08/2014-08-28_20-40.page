There is a lot that can happen within a few days: after rolling out the
[first version of our quicklooks](/blog/2014/08/2014-08-26_20-24.html) for
the inspection of the data from the pre-environmental tests before the upcoming
calibration campaign, being confronted with real-world data spawned a flurry of
changes to the code. First of all there was performance: extracting the track of
the laser diode shining onto the detector pixels turned out to be prohibitive for
larger datasets. It took a while going through the underlying routine in order a)
not only to identify where exactly processing time was burned up but b) come up
with an improvement. That the latter was indeed the case became evident from a
number of timing runs: with a factor 4-5 speed-up visual inspection of the data
from the laser diode scans became feasible. However, as seen from one of the first
[real-world results](/blog/2014/08/2014-08-27_23-32.html) are number of
additional modifications where in order...

![Scanning data quicklook](/blog/2014/08/2014-08-28_Quicklook_scanning.png)

If the motion of the scanning laser across the plane of the detector no longer is
a single smooth motion, but rather a number of subsequent scans (e.g. along one of
the detector pixel coordinate axes), the resulting plots contain clusters of data
points for which the time-sequence information -- at least not without some
additional visual encoding -- becomes lost. As a first measure to gain back some
insight, the data points are now drawn using a color scale following the chronological
order. Though already I have seen cases where this still might not be enough to
disentangle multiple sub-sets of laser measurements, the colouring greatly improves
readability of the plots and understanding the nature of the measurements.
