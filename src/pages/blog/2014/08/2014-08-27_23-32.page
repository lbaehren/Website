[As already explained](/blog/2014/08/2014-08-26_20-24.html) I have been spending
a good proportion of my recent time working on the implementation of quicklooks for
the data taken during the calibration measurement campaign(s). After going from the
conceptional idea -- what to plot and how -- to a first working implementation, for
the past two days I now had a chance to actually get some real world experience with
the routines I have been writing. As it turns out going from simulated test data
(as used for running the unit tests) to actual measurement data is quite a change...
and hence the outcome is less clear to read:

While some of the plots are pretty straight-forward to read, especially the 3D
scatter plot might need some fine-tuning -- some color-coding of the points might
help to guide the viewer's eyes. Perhaps a good idea to consult event displays used
in particle physics experiments...
