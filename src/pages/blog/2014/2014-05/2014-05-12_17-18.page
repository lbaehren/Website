Looks as though the main issue has been resolved now: the idea of using values from
an enumeration as template parameter for a class now finally works. While the original
code already was close to what it had to be, it required a little bit of internet
search to connect the missing dots: instead of writing

~~~~ cpp
template <typename T> class Lx
~~~~

the correct code had to be

~~~~ cpp
template <swir::data::StorageFormat T> class Lx
~~~~

since ``StorageFormat`` was a custom defined enumeration. With this bit out of the
way I now can go ahead and set up some of the subsequent code the way I originally
already had been envisioning this for the _Data Access Library_ (DAL) developed for
the [LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org) radio-telescope.
