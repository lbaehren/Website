Das ist natuerlich auch eine Art, wie man (Negativ-)Werbung machen kann:

> From the start, Scroogled has been dedicated to exposing Google’s violations of your privacy.  We’ve shown you how Google goes through every single word of every single email sent to or from your Gmail account to target you with ads, how they serve up shopping results that are actually paid ads, how they share your contact information with app developers, how they monetize web searches that students do in school, and even how they say email users have no expectation of privacy. The list goes on and on.
>
> This has struck a chord. Millions of people have visited Scroogled.com and hundreds of thousands have signed the petitions to tell Google to stop violating their privacy.  Now, there’s a new way for people to express themselves and their misgivings about Google – with Scroogled gear from the brand new Scroogled Store.

Interessant in diesem Zusammenhang ist natuerlich zu wissen, wer hinter dieser Kampagne steckt:

> [Scroogled](http://www.scroogled.com) is an ongoing campaign by Microsoft that criticizes Google on a number of fronts. The campaign was created for Microsoft by Mark Penn and started in late November 2012. The campaign aims to drive users away from Google's services by attacking Google services. It is part of an effort by Microsoft to make users switch to Microsoft's products and services such as Outlook.com and Bing.

Da juckt es mich natuerlich einmal in den Finger mich auf die Suche nach entsprechenden Sites und/oder Kampagnen in Gegenrichtung zu gehen... ist aber vielleicht garnicht noetig, weil die Produkte in der Hinsicht schon fuer sich sprechen.
