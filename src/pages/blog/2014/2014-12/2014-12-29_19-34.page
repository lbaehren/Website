It is happening: after month and years of preparations the TROPOMI instrument not
only is at the [Centre Spatial de Liege](http://www.csl.ulg.ac.be) (CSL) [testing
facility](http://www.csl.ulg.ac.be/jcms/c_5574), but since a few days there is a
continuous stream of measurement data coming in!

So while there is still the need to continue working on the calibration algorithms,
there of course is the more immediate need to respond to any problems encountered
while the calibration measurements are running. Part of this support was the request
arriving this afternoon for the creation of a small webpage to provide an overview
of the available quicklook documents (basically a collection of diagnostics plots).
Nothing big, just a simple webpage with a list of files (and a link for downloading
them) -- something like this:

The pretty much straight-forward way to do this is (once more) coming up with a short
shell script to locate the PDF files... and write out some HTML code. The latter is
something I haven't been doing in quite a while: what I have been doing instead was
to run some simple markup text files through e.g. [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org)
or -- as is the case for this website -- use a static website generator to handle the
task. So this time it is back to the basics.

~~~~~~~~ bash
html_header ()
{
    echo "<html>"
    echo "  <head>"
    echo "    <meta name=\"author\" content=\"Lars Baehren\" />"
    echo "    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"TROPOMI SWIR quicklooks\" />"
    echo "    <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"TROPOMI, SWIR, Quicklook, SRON\" />"
    echo "    <meta name=\"generator\" content=\"Lars Baehren\" />"
    echo "  <head>"
    echo "  <body>"
    echo ""
    echo "    <h1>TROPOMI SWIR quicklooks</h1>"
    echo ""
    echo "    <i>Page generated `date`</i>"
    echo ""
}
~~~~~~~~

Luckily nothing fancy is required, so whipping a few lines of bash script to generate
HTML output isn't a big deal. Of course there always is the risk to start overdoing it
once there first working version is out: there is always something to tweak and improve,
be it making adjustments to the layout, add navigation links, etc. However for the
time being nothing of the like is in the works, so all there is to it is to let "cron"
run the script(s) and provide the people back at SRON or CSL (Luik, BE) with the input
they need.
