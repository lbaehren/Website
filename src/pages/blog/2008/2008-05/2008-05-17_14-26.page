Catalina just pointed me to some interesting page for a photography competition others might be interested in (as well):

> How many times have you walked down a street in your neighbourhood and wondered just how so many different people came to live together in this particular place? Everyone has a story. Now that the borders within Europe are fading, people from an even greater mix of cultures and backgrounds are coming together, mingling their voices in an ever growing dialogue of their unique stories and experiences.

If you continue reading a little bit, this sounds like a very interesting topic which allows for the submission of a lot of diverse and interesting pictures. Have a look, details are available through www.street-cultures.eu -- have fun shooting!
