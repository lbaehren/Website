As if the [NAC](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157604927933466) would not have been enough...

Already as a note in my concert/festivals calendar I had a note concerning the [Jazz in Duketown](http://www.jazzinduketown.nl), a three days Jazz festival in 's-Hertogenbosch, just a 30 minutes train ride from Nijmegen. However what I did not have in my calendar was another music festival right here in Nijmegen -- advertised in numerous posters all over town: the [Music Meeting](http://www.musicmeeting.nl). The kind of logical choice for the Saturday therefore was to check out what was going on in Park Brakkenstein, just on the backside of the University campus.

The outcome of that excursion was not too remarkable, since (a) the music was not too much fitting my mood and (b) I once more felt a bit intimidated by the amount of photographers present. As a result there are only a few pictures I took from the concert on the main stage in the park, the quality of those however quite ok (see below).

The bigger thing definitely was the Jazz festival in 's-Hertogenbosch -- _Jazz in Duketown_, a nice play of words with the city's name. As for the setting and the overall atmosphere, this reminded a lot of the last fall's Jazz festival in Delft (the one I visited together with Oliver). Like the rest of the week already, the weather was presenting itself from the sunny side -- thus the perfect setting for an outdoor festival with numerous stages spread over the center of the city.

The parallels to Delft even went a deal further, when at the stage in the Snellestraat I ran into a brass trio I already had heard and seen in Delft -- [The Brass Babes](http://www.bandsandfriends.nl/thebrassbabes). Even though I always claim I have a very bad memory for people, apparently visual impressions stick quite well, such that I immediately recognized the three of them. Needless to say I have been staying for quite a while to extend my picture collection.
