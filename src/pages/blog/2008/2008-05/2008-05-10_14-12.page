What a good thing that storage is getting cheap. Even though this has been on the horizon for a while now, after this week's [[http://www.astron.nl/p/nac2008|NAC]] the extension of the local storage capacities could not be delayed any more. Even after three or four iterations sifting through the [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157604927933466|images brought back home]] I am left with something of the order 20 GB from the three days in Dalfsen; may sound a little bit insane, but given the circumstances this is not a too unusual number. Especially since the D300 has become my main camera (which I guess was to be expected), the amount of image data is growing in a unprecedented speed; in addition to that we have of course also the fact, that the number of occasions I am out there shooting has dramatically increased since last year -- so some of the original assumptions and provisions are no longer standing the test of time.

Following the various discussions during the NAC -- with [[http://www.carolune.org|Carolina]] and [[http://stevenrieder.com|Steven]] on storage and backup strategies, but also with Johan Hamaker on the development of storage media and their prizes -- the logical thing to do today, was to go out and get me some additional storage space, most likely including the option for redundancy. Following the previous purchase I was thinking along the lines of getting two external 500 GB USB 2.0 drives, which then could be configured as a RAID 1, to at all times have two copies of all my pictures. Arriving at the computer store however I had to notice, that by now the EUR/GB ratio for 500 and 750 GB drives has leveled -- so an increase by a factor 1.5 in storage space translates into the same number in prize; given the other investments so far, spending 300 EUR on 1.5 TB of storage did not appear as an insane idea to me. Unfortunately however, only a single 750 GB disk was available at the time, such that I am required to pick up the second drive the upcoming week. With that the image data will be moved from the current 320 GB drive to a two times 750 GB RAID 1, offering
  - a considerable increase in storage space and
  - redundancy of the data.
I think especially the last point will considerably contribute to a more sound sleep at night. So by the end of next week I will be passing the 2 TB storage barrier -- if someone had told me this to happen a year ago I might have laughed, but I guess this is how things evolve and and change.
