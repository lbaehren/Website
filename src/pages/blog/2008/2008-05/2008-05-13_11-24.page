... at least when around here in Nijmegen: an empty office all for myself. Since being unaware that there would not be a WHAM (Weekly High-Energy and Astrophysics Meeting), I came in rather early and since then haven't had anyone else in the office. Ok, to be completely honest, Cisca was here a while ago, but this hardly can count as disturbance. Most important factor -- I guess -- is that I can just do "my thing" without any complaining remarks and other bitching on whatever is not "the way I would do this". Not too much of a surprise that these -- along with some of the hours spend at the desk at home -- are the most productive hours anyway.
