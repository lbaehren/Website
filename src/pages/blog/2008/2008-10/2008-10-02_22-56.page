Now this is what I really call some good news:

> I have successfully compiled DAL both on my RHEL4 workstation and on the FC7 Tier 1 machine.  pydal loads as expected on my workstation, but I have seen some somewhat unusual occurrences.  I will do some more comprehensive tests and send the results when I'm done (some time tomorrow).

After investing so many hours into expanding the functionality of the DAL,
debugging it and adjusting the configuration and build, the effort has finally
paid of. The mail which just arrived from Groningen is great news indeed,
because it demonstrates that I am spending my working hours on something
useful... something which still needs to be hammered into people's here in
Nijmegen.
