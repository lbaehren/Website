It's not even a week that I went to Arnhem in order to buy a Drobo -- including
two 1 TB drives -- and already I have taken the step to fully mount the system.
Not necessarily that there was any real urge to perform an upgrade -- the
storage space would have lasted for a bit -- but seeing the two empty bays on
the device made such a sad impression that I simply had to fill them up. As a
consequence I started looking out for the best place within reach to get the
additional drives (500 GB or larger); turned out that a) not only the shop I was
last Saturday is the best address close to Nijmegen and b) that the 1 TB Western
Digital drives I got as part of the offer are the best deal. With the long
shopping hours on Thursday I decided to make another quick trip to Arnhem to
pick up the drives (unfortunately the trip back from Dwingeloo the day before
was a bit to late to to this then).

An hour later -- which also included looking around a bit -- I arrived back
home, two more 1 TB drives in my pockets, ready to get installed. In order to
get some feeling for the capabilities the device is praised for, decided to
insert at least on of the drives while actually transferring data onto the
Drobo. Worked as smoothly as advertised:

 - Remove front plate (which is held in place magnetically, so there are no clips or screws to loosen).
 - Insert the disks into the empty bays.
 - Put the front plate back on.

Yes, that really is all there is to it: no need to stop whatever you are doing
with or to the data stored on the Drobo. In order to make sure the device was
busy I actually started the transfer of some video data from the laptop onto the
Drobo -- adding the new drives however did not require halting any of the
ongoing activities.

The total amount of available storage space is display by the Drobo Dashboard; I
made screen-shots during each step of the upgrade, i.e. before adding the new
drives and after each single addition. Controls and storage statistics are
updated on the fly as the new drives are added. The system is now filled with 4
TB, which gives me 3 TB of protected storage.
