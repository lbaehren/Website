Looks like I am a bit back in the game. After the rather frustration experience of having to stay in bed for most of the past weekend -- and thereby passing on a few opportunities to do some photography -- it looks as though I might be getting some compensation fairly soon. As I originally was looking forward for another [Non-Divine](http://non-divine.com) concert, this should become true after all (even though in an even bigger set-up). I still had in mind, that there was a larger set up concerts schedules as support for [Flotsam and Jetsam](http://www.flotsam-and-jetsam.com), which definitely should be a chance to catch _Non-Divine_ on a considerably bigger stage as was the case at _Rockcafe Backstage_ (which was very small and poorly lit). Checking out the group's website I noticed that there were two concerts at the end of this week here in the Netherlands, which both are well within reach for me... so I sent a mail to Ivor van Beek (the guitarist and singer of the band) whom I contacted the last time:

> Hi Ivor,

Looking into you current tour schedule I noticed the two upcoming concerts in Zwolle and Eindhoven: I would really be interested to do photography on both events. How to proceed - do I also need to contact Hedon and Dynamo?

I parallel I already notified Catalina to see wether there would be interest for pictures and a review either for Heavy Metal Magazine and/or the Metalfan website; little surprise that this is material of use for both sources.

Great thing is, that a reply from Ivor did not take too long:

> Hi Lars,

> Great, thanks! I e-mailed our Agency how to deal with press/guestlist in your case. I let you know.

So unless something really ugly is coming up, I am planning to show up in both Zwolle and Eindhoven the upcoming weekend -- doing some nice concert photography.
