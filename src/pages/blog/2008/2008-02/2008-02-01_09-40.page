After the repeated trouble with the [[http://usg.lofar.org|USG server]] and little -- or actually no -- action from part of the [[http://www.astron.nl|ASTRON]] ICT people, I yesterday had another look at the machine myself. Talking to Ruud last week I had been made aware of the fact that a major portion of the computer mounted in the right-most racks in the server room would be removed and put out of service; as there was no further use for them, whatever hardware I felt in need of could be salvaged and used for our machine. As a consequence of this I yesterday afternoon checked out what was still left in the racks to see if there were any spare parts I might be able to use; turned out that only a single machine, the previous ''lofar12'', was left -- therefore making the choice rather simple. To start with I have been taking the machine out of the rack to open it up and see what was still inside that could be used for the USG server. Not yet willing to go for a complete replacement of components, I at least started with two obvious parts which could be considered for upgrading or machine: additional memory and a second hard-drive.

Moving ''lofar12'' out of the way I then shut down the server to put it on the work-bench and insert the additional parts. Rebooting from the trusted Knoppix CD -- which once more proved to be a valuable asset to keep around -- I was able to detect a problem with the cabling of the two disks, such that could make some adjustments there before rebooting the machine from its ow system disk. While the additional memory is in operation, a further fix will be required next week to also get the second disk operational; of this is something I really would love to have, since this not only will be a simple expansion of storage space, but also will enable me to do some internal mirroring. Whether the machine will stay online for that period of time is still something I am not too convinced of, but this remains to be seen; the good news about this however is, that Andre promised to personally take care of getting us some intact hardware to get back to a stable system (as we had before the forced take-down).

Maybe another side-note on why things are more complicated as they would have to be. As I learned yesterday, the fact that we are running our services on a designated LOFAR computer is something which almost automatically puts us out of the service area of ASTRON's ICT department. It is kind of important to note, that even though ASTRON has the main responsibility for building up the main infrastructure of the LOFAR telescope, the project is like a separate entity within the building; and since a lot of the people working in the building have a rather working-by-the-book attitude, anything they are not explicitly ordered to do will not be done by them (a fact which already has caused me quite some scratching my head in the past). The additional factor to make things more troublesome internally is that I have secured full access rights to the machine, such that effectively I am the administrator of the machine; this by itself already is something, which (a) is not looked upon to well and (b) causes ICT to step away from all responsibility. Of course this immediately would bring up the question why to go solo in the first place and not make use of the already existing network infrastructure and services provided by ASTRON as an institute. The answer is pretty straight-forward: if I would be able to trust people to provide the required services we are in need of, I would be happy being able to step away from the task and spend my time working on other thing (essentially concentrating on the software development) -- but given past experience, I feel that even in the light of recent troubles we are still better off with the solution we have chosen for.
