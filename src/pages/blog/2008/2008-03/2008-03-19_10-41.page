That was a rather fast one. Last night -- one of the last things before going to sleep -- I sent out an email to Kobus, asking him about the L.I.N.E. concert tomorrow in Amsterdam. Well, a reply was in already when I checked my mail this morning from the guest house:

> Leuk dat je wilt komen! We beginnen rond 22.30/23.00 en spelen tot 24.00. Foto's maken mag natuurlijk altijd. 
>
> Laat me even weten of zeker weet dat je komt. Dan zal ik je op de gastenlijst zetten, dat scheelt je weer 7,50 euro entree. :-)
>
> Misschien tot donderdag dan! 

So it looks like I am once more branching out a little bit. With Kobus and Chantal leaving _Noah_ I will try to keep in touch with both of them, following up on whatever activities they are embarking on. I guess that when doing a decent job tomorrow evening in Amsterdam, I will have another band on my list of which I will be collecting photographs.
