Hurray, I just got a call from the Apple Service Center in Arnhem: according to them my dearly missed MacBook Pro has been repaired and is available for retrival at the shop. The first statement of the guy on the telephone was, that there has been a problem with the logic board (whatever exactly this means, but I intend to find out). So no doubt about it -- I am going to Arnhem in a few minutes to finally, finally end the absence of the computer I have become so dependent upon. Let's hope everything else is fine with the machine, such that it is up to crunching the code and processing the pictures.
