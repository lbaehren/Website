Before getting into the details let's make one thing clear right upfront: if so far you haven't been able to see [[http://www.kamelot.com|Kamelot]] live in concert yet... make sure this is getting a high priority position on whatever concert wish-list you might be keeping. **Kamelot** deliver an amazing show which captures the audience from the first moment to the very last.

Given the high demand for more live shows after the release of the "Ghost Opera" album, **Kamelot** end of October last year announced to be touring Europe once more -- Roy Khan: “This Ghost Opera Tour will be our last tour of Europe until the next studio release, so we are planning even more specials for the fans!” The original plan foresaw Greek phenoms [[http://www.firewind.gr|Firewind]] and Austrian/American female fronted gothic metal band [[http://www.visionsofatlantis.com|Visions of Atlantis]] to be touring with Kamelot. Due to changes in the line-up of the latter band however VoA had to cancel their participation, the spot handed over to the Spanish gothic metal band [[http://www.foreverslave.com|Forever Slave]].

A first real idea of what the evening might be came at entering the concert hall: the Paradiso in Amsterdam, a previously church building, proved to be an environment almost perfectly suited for an event of something called the "Ghost Opera Tour". With its double-level balconies encircling the stage, supported by stone pillars, this was as close to a theater one could possibly get -- even might some be expecting an orchestra pit somewhere close to the stage.

The evening was opened on 18:30h by **Forever Slave**, who did not leave too much of an impression. Besides that it actually took a while to realize the band had entered the stage (which was lit only very dimly during the whole performance), the audience responded only mildly to the music and its presentation. The fact that a considerable fraction of that evening's listeners not even would show up right from the begin could have been read as a sign; as for the audience present, the band seemed to fail establishing a real connection, such that by the end of the rather short four-pieces set people were growing impatient and started calling for Firewind. The most obvious weakness of the band on that evening might be considered the vocal performace of the lead singer, Lady Angellyca: besides being being barely audibly in the sound mix the voice itself appeared off-key quite a number of times and too thin to stand against the instrumental layer of the music.

Next in line -- starting at about 19:00h -- **Firewind** delivered a great job warming up the audience for the main act of the evening. Though obviously not known to too many people, the band fairly quickly was able to establish a connection to the audience and delivered a well crafted and solid performance. With the definite advantage of being audible against his band-mates, singer Apollo Papathanasio was alive and charismatic, such that even a reserved response to a question like "Do you know this song from our first album?" did not further affect the perception as a well-done choice as special guest during the Kamelot tour. The set-list contained snapshots from all across Firewind's discography: //Into the fire//, //Head up high//, //Mercenary man//, //Circle of life// (The Premonition, 2008), //Falling to pieces// (Allegiance, 2006), //I am the anger// (Between Heaven And Hell, 2002) and //Between Heaven And Hell// (Burning Earth, 2003).

At 20:30h the moment everybody had been waiting for dearly finally was announced by all the lights going down: when slowly turned up again just a single female silhouette was revealed center-stage, rising out of the mist, backlit by cool blue light, violin with bow-on... presenting the audience with the opening of //Solitaire//. After vanish back into the darkness only a moment later the band entered the stage, picking up the song as the first one in their set that evening -- the welcome was enthusiastic and heartily. //Rule The World// saw the first use of pyro-techniques, columns of fire rising up into the air, painting the whole scenery into an intense orange/yellow light, adding a violent and archaic element to the presentation of the song. The follow-ups were //When The Lights Are Down//, //Soul Society// and //The Pendulous Fall//.

The enthusiastic response of the audience took another considerable leap the instant the first bars of the next song were identified belonging to //Centre Of The Univere//; if not already before, people now definitely were jumping around and singing along at the top of their voice. With this first climax the switch to the more calm and introspective atmosphere of //Abandoned// was a great choice, providing Khan to show off his vocal talents in transporting the feeling of sadness with his voice. After this quieter part //Decent of the Archangel// once more struck aggressive chord, leveling the field for Khan to take a break while the rest of the band presented an impressive instrumental composition, showcasing each of the players. After //The Human Stain// the sound effects very quickly gave away that //The Haunting// was on the list next; this immediately generated some speculations if -- given the fact we were in the Netherlands -- we might have another special appearance for the duet (maybe Simone?). This was not the case, but given the beautiful vocal performance by Anne-Catrin Märzke, who interacted very well with Khan, not a word of disappointment would be left.

After this -- and //Edenecho// -- the end of the regular set was preluded by a keyboard solo, transitioning into... //Forever//. Recognizing the song for what it was -- some needed more but the first two bars -- the audience almost took over the vocal duties from Khan. As Thomas commented on later: "I thought Roy was singing but it was you guys, soooo LOUD!" But it was not only loudness, but also the persistence, which resulted in a considerably longer call-and-response in the middle of the song as the band had been preparing for (which was quite obvious from their reactions, as the attempt to simply get the audience tired of singing would not work).

Releasing the 1400+ faces crowd back into the Amsterdam night under such circumstances would not work without encores. Given the load demand for more, the band re-entered the rather quickly, performing //Ghost Opera//, //Love You To Death// and //Karma//. Still not fed up -- how could one? -- the audience kept on longer for more; stretching the time until curtain call a little longer, the final showdown was well rewarded: //The March of Mephisto// concluded an amazing evening, leaving everybody exhausted and with both a small tear and a gleaming in the eyes.

So the bottom-line... same as the very first remark: if the //Ghost Opera Tour// passes your way, do not miss it. Roy Khan, Thomas Youngblood, Glenn Barry, Oliver Palotai and Casey Grillo indeed have every prospect to rule the world.
