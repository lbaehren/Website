Now here finally is the solution to the problem with the key-card. A few minutes ago I paid another visit to the reception downstairs in the entrance hall. Since Esther already had sent out a message, my visit was expected. Presenting my new card -- and verifying it still would not work -- we ran a check on the system-internal settings for my card. Turns out the thing was only registered as valid until 1. January -- no wonder even getting a new card would not help. Lucky enough extending the validity of the card was not a problem, such that now -- finally -- I once again have full access to the department at all times (I guess as usual you really start missing things, once you have to go without them).

So how come, I was even able to in on January 2nd? Easy, since this was a regular working day here at the university, so all the doors were opened already -- and thereby no need for me to use the card... until in the evening, which is when it hit me.
