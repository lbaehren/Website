... is that -- when not being the only one around with a camera -- you might end being photographed as well. Already happened to me twice last year, once at the Rheinkultur festival and the then a number of times during the Samba-Festival here in Nijmegen. The latest addition to this series is a picture taken at the concert I went to Saturday evening in Delft (where I went to originally for the [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) in-store appearance in a record shop). Visiting a number of places I had been to last fall during the Jazz Festival, in front of a club I ran into someone who suggested me to come later that evening, since his band would be having a record release party. Even though I never heard of the band before -- [Karma's Kitchen](http://www.karmaskitchen.nl) -- I was curious enough to promise dropping in later... given of course I was allowed to take pictures ;-) The latter proved to be not a problem at all, I guess he was quite happy with the chance of getting some additional coverage. So after the _Ayreon_ event was over, I got myself something to eat and went to the [Speakers](http://www.speakers.nl).

While I showed up that evening rather by accident, there were two more photographers around which definitely knew about the event way before me. One of them, [Paul Barendregt](http://paulbarendregt.nl), seemed to be very comfortable with his Canon camera plus a nice collection of not exactly cheap looking lenses. As both of us were setting up our gear there was the immediate recognition from both sides, that each of us was taking the whole photography issue a bit more seriously than most other people in the room. This was actually quite fun, since we kept interacting throughout the evening, at least keeping note of how the other was arranging angles and choosing lenses.

Trying to track down the name of the band which opened for _Karma's Kitchen_ that evening I went to the website of the venue, only to find that already two photo galleries where only from the evening in question. Naturally the next thing I went for was to have a closer look -- which is when I found the picture below. As Catalina already remark quite right, there is a roughly 50/50 split in picture area between face and lens... but you should remember I was there to take pictures, not to pose in front of somebody else's lens.
