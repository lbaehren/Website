It is done! We all knew this was about to come at some point in time, but since noon today it is official: Andreas Nigl's PhD thesis entitled "Fast Radio Flashes Observed with LOFAR Prototypes" is the first PhD thesis completed within the framework of the LOFAR project, working with actual data recorded with prototype installations such as LOPES (Karlsruhe), LORUN (Nijmegen) and ITS (Exloo). The picture taken shortly after the ceremony already has been submitted to the ASTRON dayly image.

For my this now finally was the first chance of a serious shooting using the camera/lens combinations I was planning to use for some of the upcoming concerts:

 * 70-200mm f/2.8 VR mounted on the D300
 * 50mm f1.4 mounted on the D80

Turns out that especially the first combination is a very powerful package, since the sharpness of the zooom combined with the high ISO capabilities of the camera make a great match. The pictures are about to show up within the next days on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157603773245056) -- after some basic inspection and (if required) prost-processing touches.
