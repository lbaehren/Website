After the first, rather rushed, upload of a few frames from the [CD presentation in Delft](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157603800476228) this Saturday, there are now further pictures from the same event, but more imortant the first frames from [yesterday's pre-release party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157603807205352) at _Stairway to Heaven_ in Utrecht.

I already sent word to Lori Linstruth that the frames are available through Flickr (were she agreed upon was a resonable way to publish them). The collection however is not complete yet, because -- as to be expected - more frames have been taken as could be inspected and checked the previously night (unless I wanted to get at least a little bit of sleep). The overall outcome is reasonable, though I am disappointed that (a) there was so little room to get various angles and (b) a fair amount of frames turned out improperly focussed; I am not entirely sure what the cause of this is, but I definitely was expecting a higher fraction of frames to turn out keepers. I am not saying that there weren't any good frames at all, but still too few for my taste and also too many standard situations...
