Yes, we are getting closer to it with every passing day. This afternoon I came across another short news item -- I was actually chasing for something completely different, but we all know who these things work. On the www.ytsejam.com website (mind the reference), there is an announcement for the upcoming release party of the new [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) album:

> Between 10 and 15 guest artists will join Arjen for an impromptu acoustic set at Stairway to Heaven in Utrecht on 27 January. The set list includes new songs from 01011001 as well as selected Ayreon classics. All versions of 0101101 AND new Ayreon T-shirts will be available at our merchandise booth, so don't miss this chance to get loads of autographs!

There is also and approximate schedule available already:

> 13:00 - Doors open
>
> 14:00 - 15:00 Various activities, 01011001 bonus DVD preview, etc.
>
> 15:00 - 15:50 Acoustic set
>
> 16:00 - 17:00-ish Meet and greet with Arjen and guests
>
> 17:15 - Last call for signing!

If there are really that many other musicians joining in, I might be able to get quite a lot of interesting pictures from the event (of course I am hoping for the two Jansen sisters, Simone Simons and maybe Russel Allen...). I think I need to do some final preparations, in order not to run out of memory cards or something like it -- would be a shame if something like that went wrong. 

So once more: entrance is free, but the number of people who can get in is limited, so either be there in time or check to get your name on the guest list.
