As I promised to the folks from the band, by today I have the [first batch of pictures online](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157603930706788). When I was checking out their [website](http://www.noahonline.nl), there already were a number of new entries in the guestbook, also asking for what the deal was with the picture. Well, I glad that this problem could be resolved, because it looks like there won't be any pictures from the band itself (they of course brought their usual pocket camera, but there was a problem with the batteries). Does this put some pressure on me? Perhaps a little bit, because this might cause higher expectation, especially when you are walking around with pro-type equipment. As I have encountered already during the two shootings at Carnival, the environment of such a party is something one really needs to get used to; whereas under different circumstances people may turn away from the camera, here it is rather that some almost tend to attach themselves to the lens.

The location -- at least in some sense -- was a bit of a photographers dream; a reasonably large dance floor with plenty of room around it, such that there was no problem moving around. Even better was the fact that the large room had a gallery running around 3/4 of the circumference (see picture below); this opened up the opportunity to get a large variety of angles: ground-to-gallery, gallery-to-ground, gallery-to-gallery -- I definitely could have a taken a hundred more picture of people dancing and listening to the music (thereby for the first time exceeding the space on the 8 GB memory card).

As you might have noticed from the above shot, there even have been to platform extending from the gallery into the space above dance floor. A fantastic location to either set yourself up to get an unobstructed view onto the stage (though some of the light-right might get in the way) or to have you lens pointed to. The girls in the picture below were just partying the night away -- which caused them to show up on more but a single frame.

The other thing I noticed today, when going through the [Noah website](http://www.noahonline.nl) to look for comments in the guest-book, was that the [fansite for the singer Chantal](http://www.ladyc.nl.tt) has been updated recently. In fact the update most have been fairly recently, because the pictures used to create the banner at the top of the page have been taken from the shots I have been taking at the concerts in Heesch and Berghem. After the Vierdaagse in Nijmegen this now already is the second time my material has been featured on the website - looks like I am not doing too bad after all.
