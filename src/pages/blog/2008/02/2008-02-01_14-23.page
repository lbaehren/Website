I was really hoping to get a slightly extended grace period before the server would become unstable again -- turns out that this time it even took less time for the machine to go out of service once more. After [yesterday's efforts](2008-02-01_09-40.html) the setup latest until the backup at 22:00h, such everything was incommunicado when I arrived at the office this morning. Taking up Andre's offer I sent in an email asking if he could to a hardware-reset. Turned out however, that he miscalculated the amount by which the reset button had to press in, such that the reset was not exectued and the machine remained in the state it had been since last night. Since I was not aware of this small detail my interpretation was, that the machine immediately gone down again, which (a) made me worry even more and (b) got me picking up the phone to ask Andre for his service once more. Monitoring his activities from remote I could see that nothing changed in the behavior of the machine, even after being told the reset had been executed. Asking for a description of what was being displayed in the monitor next to machine helped finding the cause for the things I was expecting to take place not to happen. Choosing a pen instead of a key then did the trick to really trigger the hardware reset. As a result the machine is back alive -- for now -- such that I immediately logged in to secure some additional settings if I have to set up a replacement machine. A big thanks goes to Andre for helping out!
