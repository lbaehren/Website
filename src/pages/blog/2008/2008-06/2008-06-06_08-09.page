It has been a while since the [last report](/blog/2008/2008-05/2008-05-18_12-13.html) on what is going on in terms of photography activities and possible usages of the generated pictures -- so here a short update.

One of the things I mentioned shortly before taking off to Romania was that I had been contacted on behalf of [Schmap Guides](http://www.schmap.com) for a possible inclusion of one of my [Rheinkultur](http://www.rheinkultur.com) pictures into the second edition of the Germany guide. As it now turns out I indeed made it from the short list into the edition:

> Hi Lars,

The other thing -- we also came as some sort of a surprise -- was a request sent in by Gijs Nelemens: 

> Hoi Lars,

> Er komt een verhaaltje over onze supernova in een boek van Govert Schillig en daar wil hij graag een foto van mij bij hebben. Nou dacht ik aan een mooie "actiefoto" die jij van mij hebt gemaakt op de weekendschool. Vraag 1: mag dat? Vraag 2: heb je een hogere resolutie dan de 1024 x 682, of is dat niet nodig voor print? Het gaat om:

During the weekendschool in March I had been taking a number of pictures from the event, which later I also forwarded to the organizers. One of the very nice aspects of that event was to have all these children and their teachers engaged in intense discussions (which is always something that can be turned into great pictures); from this sort of activity I got a series of shots showing Gijs in a conversation with one of the kids. With an upcoming book publication including an article on Gijs's work on a Supernova progenitor, there was the need for a picture to go along with that article. I do not know which other options there have been to chose from, but what has been picked was one of my pictures taken during the weekend-school at the University. I think I definitely need to ask for a copy, just to make sure I start building up a collection/archive of publications.
