Christmas time has been very productive in terms of getting in touch with new
music -- perhaps even a bit too productive, given the fact that do not know yet
how and when to listen all the new material lying around.

  * The name [Chris Poland](http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Poland) has been popping up quite a while ago when I got into a discussion on various guitarists. During one of my traditional visits to "Kling Klang" -- a record store in Bonn -- I got into a conversation with one of the guys working there; since earlier conversations had turned up interesting new ideas, this one left me with the impression that indeed "Return to Metalopolis" was worth listening to. Doing a bit of a search on my own I noticed that in fact this album is regarded quite highly -- all the more reason to have a listen. Unable to find the album myself it was Catalina who finally was able to dig it up.
  * The [Michael Schenker Group](http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Schenker+Group) should ring a bell with anybody mildly familiar with hard-rock music from Germany; Michael Schenker had been playing with **U.F.O.** and the **Scorpions** before embarking on a solo-career.
  * [Gojira](http://www.last.fm/music/Gojira) was something I came across while browsing through some music directory. Maybe not too much the thing for me, but I already noticed Catalina has been giving it a try.
  * [Symphorce](http://www.last.fm/music/Symphorce) was yet another suggestion I picked up on ''last.fm'' while exploring cross-connections of the artists already in my music library. Solid stuff worth listening to.
  * [The Great Kat](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Great+Kat) is the stage name of Katherine Thomas, an English-born, Long Island NY raised, musician best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but some have her on violin. Thomas is in fact a classically-trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal. A rather extreme figure even within the scene, I came across her way back while searching for female guitarists. If I do like her material? Not necessarily, but any survey would be incomplete without her.
  * **Ursus** is a spanish band I stumbled across while browsing some music directories; never heard of before I was getting curious simply by the fact they were from Spain and playing Metal music.
  * [Duffy](http://www.last.fm/music/Duffy) I had never heard of before, but had been introduced to by Ina. This immediately triggered switching to [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) to search for similar artists: as a result I ended up with [[http://www.last.fm/music/Gabriella+Cilmi|Gabriella Cilmi]], [[http://www.last.fm/music/Beth+Rowley|Beth Rowley]] and [[http://www.last.fm/music/Leona+Lewis|Leona Lewis]] -- none of which I was aware of before. Even though I would not claim that theses ladies will make a long-lasting impression, it was nice once more to experience how useful the _Similar artists_ feature on ''last.fm'' is.

No guarantee the above list actually is complete, but this is what I am able to
recall; so much new material has been coming in the last days and week that it
is hard to keep up with it.
