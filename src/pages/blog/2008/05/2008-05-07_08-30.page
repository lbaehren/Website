Even though it not even are 24 hours since I picked up my latest addition to my lens collection, a _AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED_, there are a few things I can say already. Especially given the weather and light conditions yesterday evening, there was no way to just stay inside and do nothing; instead I mounted the lens in the D300 and took a little walk, just to get some first ideas what possibilities the new lens would provide me with. As a result of this there are a few very first impressions -- but to be very clear about it: these are just first impressions, not elaborate and detailed test results. 

 * First of all one really has to be amazed by the compactness of the 18-200mm. The other comparable lens in my bag so far has been the 18-135mm, the lens I purchased along with my D80. The 18-200mm is about the size of its smaller sibling -- even though offering a considerably wider zoom range and build-in vibration reduction (VR); this makes the 18-200mm are very nice "all in one" solution, if your are planning to get out there to do some photography without carrying along a heavy bag full of lenses. 
 * The zoom-range of the lens is fairly impressive. Ranging from a rather wide-angle at 18mm to a pretty close zoom at 200mm (both number of course would have to be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 for the equivalent ranges in 35mm). This enables to use a single lens for a wide variety of shots, where until not I would have needed to change lenses at least once to cover everything. Consider the following example: The two pictures below both have been taken from a vantage point overseeing the bridge on the east end of Nijmegen (hope my geography does not fail me here...). Putting a small group of people right next to the foot of the bridge into the center of the image, I took two shots just differing in focal range. ![Picture](/blog/2008/05/dsc_20080506_201758.jpg) Now going to maximum zoom what we get is: ![Picture](/blog/2008/05/dsc_20080506_201805.jpg) So once again: both images are one with the same lens -- no changing required whats-or-ever.
 * The lens-internal focussing system works very fast. Using Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) technique, the image in the viewfinder not only converges on whatever selected object ve quickly, but works -- as advertised -- quietly indeed (not that noise has ever been a factor wth any of the other lenses before). 
 * So far I had little opportunity to really make use of the VR, as the light was so bright, that there was no real need to go to long exposures. Sure, I could have forced this by choosing fairly small apertures, but I'd rather give this a shot under more realistic conditions. The one thing I was able to notice though is, that when comparing the operation of the VR with how it is with the 70-200mm, one definitely can notice the difference in glass mass in the lens, which is put into motion to stabilize the image; this however should not be too surprising, considering the aims targeted in the construction of these two lenses.
 * Once thing I already noticed with the 18-135mm is, that -- especially compared with the f/2.8 lenses in my bag -- the lens hood tends to rotate out of its nominal mount position. In the case of the 18-55mm f/2.8 and the 70-200mm f/2.8 the lens hood position on the front end of the lens can be locked -- either in forward or reversed position. On the two DX lenses however the hood is just screwed onto the lens without any locking -- all you do is turn the hood until it has reached the stop position, which means there remains the degree of freedom to rotate out of that position once again. This is exactly what happens: what even seems to be enough sometimes is to quickly turn the camera from horizontal to vertical position -- the inertia of the hood will result in a change in its relative position with respect to the optical axis. The immediate consequence of this is the presence of two shadows in diagonally opposed corners of the picture. This requires some extra care checking the line-up of lens and hood before pressing the shutter release -- a problem I never need to concerned about with the f/2.8 and f/1.4 lenses (but I guess this comes along with the whole deal, because those lenses are trimmed for higher performance and quality anyway -- at the resulting prize difference of course).

So do I think I will enjoy this new lens? Yes, I definitely will. Just two hours of playing around with it a little bit already has given me some idea of its applications; the earlier statement, that under normal circumstances -- I am not talking concerts and low-light -- this lens should be able to cover a good 90% of the requirements remains valid. It would have made things a lot more easier during the Koninginnedag, but first real usage now will be at the NAC.

Will this lens make most of what I have in my bag obsolete? Not really. Yes, it sure will more or less replace the 18-135mm, because it simple outperforms it without putting an extra burden on the user. My f/2.8 and f/1.4 lenses however are little affected by this latest addition; sure, where until now even during the day I had to grab the 70-200mm for its large focal length and VR, the 18-200mm will do the work just as fine. But as soon as we are getting into low-light conditions, there is nothing to rival the sharper glasses. 

> **Addendum:** A correction is in order for the last point mentioned in the above short-list. Turns out that it was a stupid mistake of mine and not a flaw in the lens design, which was leading up the apparent lens-hood problem. A little bit more attention to the symbols on the lens and the hood, as well as to the manual, could have resolved this right away. One needs to turn the hood beyond the point of resistance, such that the markings on the hood and the front of the lens align properly: "Align the lens hood attachment index on the hood with the lens hood mounting index on the lens, and turn the hood counterclockwise until it click stops." -- A little bit more attention to such details and instructions clearly helps...
