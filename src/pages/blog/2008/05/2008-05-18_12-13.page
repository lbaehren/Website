Before (finally, finally) moving out on vacation here a short note on what has been going on in terms of photography lately; a short entry concerning these matter was planned already a number of days, but for some reason this got shifted further and further away -- so in order not to forget about this completely here a few bits.

When showing up in the office after returning from the [NAC](2008-05-08_22-26.html), I found an interesting mail in my inbox:

> Hi Lars,

> I am writing to let you know that one of your photos has been short-listed for inclusion in the second edition of our Schmap Germany Guide, to be published mid-June 2008.

Following the provided link it turned out that one of the pictures from the concert of Calexico during last year's Rheinkultur festival had made it onto the short list of online guide. Might not be the best of all pictures done during the event, but on the other hand this is a fairly representative shot for the event. Yes, of course: just making it onto the short-list does not yet signify the picture is going to make it into the actual edition of the guide, but on the other hand it is nice the photographic material get recognized and considered by other people. So of course I agreed to a possible publication...

Once this as done, I remembered that I was talking to Maurice from [Noah](http://www.noahonline.nl) about him using some of my latest pictures on his [website](http://www.couvee.net); not only was the image material there a bit out of date, but also he really seemed to like the stuff I had produced during the first public Naoh concert with the new line-up here in Nijmegen. So during the concert in Kockengen we got to talk and I promised him to send a selection of shots he could work into his pages. And indeed, the pictures have made it into the updated website:

Only too bad that (a) the Noah concert last night had been cancelled last minute and (b) there was no time going to Amersfoort to get pictures from the [Damorchestra](http://www.damorchestra.nl). :-(
