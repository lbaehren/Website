This is serious stuff:

> Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.
>
> This is a [Debian](http://www.debian.org)-specific vulnerability which does not affect other operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.
>
> It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation.

> The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since propagated to the testing and current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.

Joe pointed me to this this afternoon, so after reading this I decided that this was something requiring rather timely action and no long delays. Obviously thhe machine I definitely want to take care of is the USG server, so this was the first choice to run an upgrade. However it turns out, that after installing the upgrade -- including a new kernel image -- a standard

would put the machine out of action and communication range. Strangely enough this is something I experience before with the desktop machine at my working place at ASTRON -- did not come back from reboot. The only thing left right now is to wait for Andre to show up tomorrow morning and reset the machine; too bad...
