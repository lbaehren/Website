There we go again with the same old problem here at the institute at Amsterdam: access to the network. Even after being here for quite a while now, I am still unconnected to the outside world, because (1) I am unable to use the router in Michael's office, (2) I do not have a valid account for he wireless networks in the building and (3) the MAC address of my Ethernet card does not match the one normally associated with the cable port here in Joe's office. I know this is nothing new, but still there has not been a change for the better; in terms of providing visitors with Internet access Amsterdam is really horrible. The only light at the end of the tunnel is, that after explaining this problem to Ralph, we now have set everything in motion to have a regular account created for me here at the institute. This is not going to help me for today, but when showing up the next time I hopefully will be able to log in and work as I am used to (and actually required to, because not being able to access the code repository poses a major problem when collaborating on software...).
