Hm, there is quite a few changes w.r.t. the way I origially had the weekend laid out for me:

 * The original motivation for not leaving to Romania before the weekend was that there was another [Noah](http://www.noahonline.nl) concert scheduled in the [De Hoeve](http://www.dehoeve.nl) in Groesbeek. As you still might remember there was this [concert in February](/blog/2008/02/2008-02-15_14-38.html) which was just amazing, to a considerable fraction due to the venue, which was pure fun to be shooting at; that gig got me a lot of great pictures, so I was absolutely looking forward going back there again and have another go. Turns out however, that the concert must have been cancelled almost last-minute; I was checking again yesterday for the starting time -- both in the Noah website and on the website of the De Hoeve; however I came up dry in both cases, no gig scheduled at all. Unfortunately no further comment could be found in the Noah Blog, so I at least posted a request for clarification on what had been going on. Would be nice to get some notification in a bit more in advannce in the future; I might suggest setting up a mailing-list, just to keep people up-to-date on touring activities (and possible changes thereto).
 * How such a notification can work I experienced for the other project Noah's bass player is involved in; after Maurice was so happy with the pictures I made during the first public Noah concert he was playing, he not only requested a number of pictures for his [website](http://www.couvee.net), but also added me to the [Damorchestra](http://www.damorchestra.nl) mailing list (after me bugging him about the possibility to come to those concerts as well and get some decent pictures...). Unfortunately I decided to cancel going to Amersfoort on a last-minute basis, since it simply turned out to tight otherwise. Given the usual chaos when closing in on a longer travel, there was no way I would have been able to finish preparations if I had lost more than 4 hours (three hours travel by train, one hour concert); this is a pity, because I really would have like to be there and take some pictures, connect to the band and perhaps continue being called in on further gigs. Sigh... Looks like I need to make arrangements for the concerts in June, one I am back in the Netherlands.
 * Another thing came up just yesterday... and unfortunately had be cancelled right away for the same reasons as the Damorchestra concert. Following up on [Carolina's blog](http://carolune.tumblr.com) I read about today's Leiden Marathon, where she had been training for (ok, not the full distance, but 10 km for start -- which already is way more as I would be able to handle). Wow was this tempting: I immediately started trying to figure out a way to cover both the concert in Amersfoort and the Marathon... without missing the train to the airport! Well, if it wasn't for my complete inability to properly plan vacation trips, this even might have worked out (though it would have been very tight); but given the way things are I had to withdrawn from the idea to go to Leiden and take pictures from the event (I'd guess Carolina will hardly be able to take pictures from her own start and finish...); I would guess Tim or Kalle might be there to cover this, but of course I'd rather like to do this myself as well. Too bad things have coincided this way.

So what remains unchanged? Well, I am still targetting the last ICE this evening to go from Arnhem to Koeln; there would be a slightly later alternative connection via Venlo and Moenchengladbach, but the minor reduction in waiting time at the aiport is not enough to compensate for the considerably longer travel time and additional changes of trains.
