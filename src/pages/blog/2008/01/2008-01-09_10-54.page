Looks like it is a bit more complicated after all -- at least more complicated as I was expecting. After last week's dilema with the key-card, yesterday I went to the university's service center right across the street, to get me a new card (really bad if you are unable to get back into your office after 18:00h). First thing not to work as planned was, that the machine to print and write the card would not be accepting card with a chip on it; even though the chip itself currently is not yet used for anything (in the near future it is intended for various university services), it would be nice to be provided with a fully equiped card. But no matter what, the only thing leaving the machine would be a completely white card with no data on it. So to at least provide me with something I was handed a card without a chip -- which is not so bad right now -- such that at least I would regain access to the building. Returning to the department however it turns out that this in fact is not the case yet: the card is still not accepted by the system, which pretty much sounds like prior activation is required once more. How exactly this is done I do not know, so I had to leave this in the capable hands of Esther, who hopefully will be able to track this down before the end of the day.
