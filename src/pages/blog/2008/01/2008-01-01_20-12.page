Should come as no surprise I really admire Arjen Lucassen's [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) activities. With the upcoming release of the new album 01011001 -- an event I am really looking forward to -- there of course are a number of online activities around that... though strictly speaking the first of the below is only loosly related:

Doing another of my [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) runs, I extended my browsing through various pages with concert pictures to actually run a search for specific band and individuals -- it is amazing what you find, once you start looking around. Anyway, one of the names which came up due to the email contact a few days back, was [Lori Linstruth](http://lorilinstruth.com). After being part of [Stream of Passion](http://www.streamofpassion.com), she recently took over the personal management of Arjen's, which also was the reason I felt comfortable enough writing an email asking about access to the release party in Utrecht. After already finding both her blog and Skype account, I now discovered that she also has an [account on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorinator). Not much there yet, but just as a matter of precaution I added her to my contacts list -- you never know what might be showing up at some point.

Once hopping from the Flickr account to Lori's website, I also had a short look at her blog, only to discover more recent update would be added to a blog on the official Ayreon website (something new to me). Following the link I encountered [Inside the Electric Castle](http://www.arjenlucassen.com/blog), already listing some of the activities surrounding the preparations for the upcoming album release. Will be interesting to see, how this new feature develops, but surely worth the visit once in a while.
