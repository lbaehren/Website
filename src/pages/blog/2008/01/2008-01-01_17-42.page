Ok, the near isn't too old yet, but this might be all the more reason to consider which event to put into the calendar for this year. Besides the already existing events in March (The Mars Volta) and April (Kamelot) the of course is a whole bunch of festivals which I should not let pass by -- especially if there is a good chance to get some decent pictures. Following up on a short discussion with a photographer I met last year at the Felft International Jazz Festival, I decided to run a small search on that type of events here in the Netherlands; turns out that in two weeks already there is the [Blues Kroegentocht Wageningen](http://www.blueskroegentocht.nl) (of which I hadn't heard of so for, but so what). From skimming through their website, this looks interesting enough to go on a short train-ride to Wageningen and check this out; the only thing I now have to due is to find out, if there is any restriction on taking pictures, since all the concerts are indoors. But maybe I am even getting used to this process, surely going through this a number of times should help acting less intimidated.

The timing is perfect, because this would be the weekend before the [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) record release party in Utrecht -- so a little exercise won't hurt.
