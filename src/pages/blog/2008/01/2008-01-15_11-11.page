Ok, so after yesterday's first checks today finally there is the time to get serious. So far I have been running all the checks and tests I knew to fin out what the status and condition of the system was; what I can tell from the outcome is, that at least the partition hosting `/usr` is not responding, even after running several versions of `fsck` on it. The course of action now will be as follows:

 - Check again that all critical data (repository, web pages, configuration files) are copied to dop71.
  - Try to install the system from scratch, using the same partitioning scheme as before (which I think was very reasonable -- at least it helped me not to loose any critical data).
 - If the system can be revived, put the data themselves back in.

If the last two points are not going to work, I think we will have at leas to put in a new hard-drive and then take it from there.
