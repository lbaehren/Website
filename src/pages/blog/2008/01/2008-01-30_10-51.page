Following up on the announcement on the official [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) website, I decided to have a look on YouTube so see whether there was some footage of Arjen's appearance at the dutch TV program _De Wereld Draait Door_. Turns out that there is, so [look it up](http://youtube.com/watch?v=chBA1bp6VQE) (even though the segment is very short).

More interesting however are the few bits obviously taken from the special edition of the "Into The Electric Castle" album, where Arjen is talking about the recording sessions with the singers he has been working with:
