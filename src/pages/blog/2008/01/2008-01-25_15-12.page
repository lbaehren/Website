Well, looks like I am indeed slowly getting better at it -- at least the email Andreas sent around a while ago was rather encouraging:

> Dear All,
>
> Lars took great pictures of my PhD defence and put already some [online](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157603773245056), see below! It was an extremely great day! I experienced it as a very very special occasion and it was a great success!
>
> Thanks a lot for all your presents and for being there during the defence and the party!

Of course this is always a bit more critical to take pictures on behalf of somebody; if you are out there on your own there is less at stake, but if you are not able to deliver, this bad. But in some sense this really is a very good exercise to help improving on your skills; I know I already this conversation with Michiel and Corina a while ago, even though I have been little active into that direction.

Of course all I was able to give Andreas right-way when he was at ASTRON on Wednesday, was a collection of pictures with little or even no post-processing. Last night I spent another hour going through the stock and make a number of adjustments here and there -- nothing big (as usual), but definitely getting an improvement on the resulting images.
