Hm, looks like I went over this a little bit too quick... Heino forwarded his reply to an email request by a greek collegue to Andreas and me -- something I felt the need to comment on, which is what I did. However once more typing was not exactly error free, but I built in a number of smaller typos, which then automatically were picked up by the spell-checker running in the background. The usual procedure of course is: you click on the word in question, get a list of suggestions and select the correct one to be used in your text. However one should really be careful with such a tool, since lacking attention to details might lead do some misunderstandings: 

> We are actually focusing on commissioning LOFAR, decommissioning is not yet on the agenda .... :-)

>> (of course or resources are already are stretch since we are focussing right now on decommissioning for LOFAR).

Obviously my lack of attention when picking the a correction of what I was typing just made my leap forward in time a little bit, which on the other hand then triggered an immediate response from Heino. Hm, or was my subconsciousness getting the best of me, trying to express some wishful thinking??
