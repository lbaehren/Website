Ok, I have to admit that I am no longer true to what I promised Catalina on the phone while riding back to Nijmegen. But after having something to eat -- meanwhile watching the DVD of the new [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) album, there is no way I could just go to bed without having a serious go at the pictures I have taken the last two days. Even though this might not be the smartest thing to begin with, I now have taken up the task to properly tag all the frames taken today; given that there are more than 400 of them and we had several artists showing up in Utrecht todey, this nothing to be done within five minutes. But on the other hand it is very intesting to get some statistics before seriously getting into the processing, because this way I get some numbers for the original frames taken of individuals (so far Lori is in a clear lead, a number not to be beaten by anyone else).
