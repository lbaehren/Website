Must be another one of these nights here in Dwingeloo which make me start doing things I would not be doing if I was in Nijmegen. With Alexander gone sleeping (can you blame him?), I do have the office completely for myself, such that I am once more tempted  by the large window directly in from of my working place. An since I am not too good on that whole "control your emotions" thing -- at least not when it comes to photography -- I had to take out the camera and once more start experimenting a little bit with the reflections in the window.

Is this now a good start for making D300 frames available to world? I do not know, but this was something I was just playing with right now and it kind of fits the mood. Of course I am expecting more intersting things to come in the near future...
