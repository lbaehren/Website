That has got to be of insterest, if you are into photography and open contents:

> Wikipedia has launched what it calls 'the world's largest photo contest' to increase the number of images of historic sites in its image database - Wikimedia Commons. The contest, called 'Wiki Loves Monuments 2012' will run throughout September 2012, with the best entry receiving a photo tour of Hong Kong, coinciding with the Wikimania 2013 conference. Wikipedia has run photographic competitions before, but this is the biggest yet, and will involve volunteers from more than 30 countries.

The news about this contest arrived through an [article in dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/news/2012/08/30/wikipedia-launches-historic-monuments-photo-contest-to-expand-commons), one of the sources I have been subscribing to, in order to keep track of some of the events in the photography world. Whether or not the competition is the driving bit for you to participate is one thing -- for Wikimedia Commons the most important part is that the images are construbutes under a free license:

> All images must be uploaded to the [Wikimedia Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org) under a free license, which means that they will be available free of charge, for use by anybody, for any purpose, as long as the photographer is credited.

Following up on the information presented in the article, the next obvious plave to check is the [website for the competition](http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org) itself:

> Wiki Loves Monuments is an international photo contest around cultural heritage monuments in September. Starting from the Netherlands in 2010 and organized on a European level in 2011, we go global in 2012!
>
> Everybody can participate and improve Wikipedia in their local and regional neigbourhood. Cultural heritage is everywhere around you, you just need to look and learn!
>
> In every participating country you can win awards, and the best photos in each country continues to the international jury â€“ which will select the best monument photos in 2012.

> Make sure to [keep track of this blog](http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org) for more information, updates and glimpses how things are going in other countries!

Given the fact that in the past already I have been taking my camera to locations where image material was needed for Wikipedia, this [contest](http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/contest) offers the opportunity for a nice little project (something a more more focussed but simly snapping pictures). Hence I am going to have a closer look at the available online resources, to get some ideas at what I could be pointing my lens.
