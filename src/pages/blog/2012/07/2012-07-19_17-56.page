I guess compared to some of the past years I really have been slowing down when ot comes to discovering new artists and band; if I am using my time in Nijmegen as point of reference, very little has been happening lately, which is quiet a shame. There is so much amazing music out there, that no going out to discover it almost seems like a crime. However I have not completely withdrawn from exploring... which is why I picked up [Karnataka](http://karnataka.org.uk) a short while back. If I remember correctly it was during a follow-up session on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) that I came across this fantastic band from England. Just taking in the fresh material, associations are all over the place -- I seem to be hearing the likes of [Yes](http://www.yesworld.com) (overall musical composition), [IQ](http://www.iq-hq.co.uk) (overall musical composition, especially the neo-prog bit) and [Within Temptation](http://www.within-temptation.com) (some of the melodies in the quieter pieces). Though it is kind of hard to take a pick, at the moment I would have to go with the most recent (2010) album "The Gathering of Light"; particularly noteworthy are "The Serpent and the Sea" and "Your World" -- brilliant stuff I hardly can stop myself from listening to.
