After pushing this around for a long time, I finally have started exploring HDR
photography. Been wanting to do this for quite a while, but was lacking the
subject matter to apply this to. Being asked to document our ever-growing garden
I noticed that this the perfect opportunity: given the range of colors and
brightnesses I decided that HDR was the way to go. While capturing the raw
material -- multiple exposures with the appropriate EV settings -- seemed rather
straight forward, the subsequent processing appears to the tricky part: there
are so many variations possible when tone-mapping -- choice of algorithm and its
control parameters - that it will take a while to have this figured out to gain
the results I am looking for. Surely will have to do some reading up on the
matter, but already now I do see the potential for being able to capture scenes
with tricky light environments (guess right now I am more going for the
technical use, rather than the artistic fine tuning).
