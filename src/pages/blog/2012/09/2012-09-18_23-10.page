While trying to track down the creators of the
[Darktable](http://www.darktable.org) software package -- I am still planning to
have it featured on the [FLOSS Weekly](http://www.twit.tv/show/floss-weekly)
show -- I discovered that one of them had relocated to New Zealand, in order to
work for [Weta Digital](http://www.wetafx.co.nz). This of course triggered a
quick jump halfway across the planet, at least digitally, directly placing
myself in front of a number of shots from
[Prometheus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714), one of the mostly anticipated
movies of this year (and yes, shame on me for still not having watched it). One
of the really fascinating background stories I already had been picking up was
an interview on [fxguide.com](http://www.fxguide.com), which provided some
in-depth insight into the creation of selected sequences. Alongside with the
interview -- distributed as a podcast -- there also is an [in-depth
article](http://www.fxguide.com/featured/prometheus-rebuilding-hallowed-vfx-space),
which in even more detail is breaking down some of the visual effects of the
film.

> In the history of modern visual effects films there is a small handful of universes worthy of religious veneration: the bed chamber in [2001](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622), the hover cars of [Blade Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658), the initial flyover from [Star Wars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759) and of course, the fallen broken ship of [Ridley Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631)’s [Alien](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748). This last hallowed and sacred site is known to all serious visual effects artists, but for a select few artists at companies like [MPC](http://www.moving-picture.com), [Weta Digital](http://www.wetafx.co.nz) and [Fuel](http://www.fuelvfx.com), they got to rebuild and reimagine these ‘consecrated’ assets -- the map room, the ship and of course the pilot’s chair from _Alien_. The film has erupted a blogosphere of arguments over the meaning or symbolism these objects have in a creationist tale of mankind, but virtually without question even the harshest critics of the film have applauded the stunning visual effects of _Prometheus_.

If you want to understand some of the magic which has been used behind the scenes to create the visuals, this is a must-read article!
