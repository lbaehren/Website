In a [recent post on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105237212888595777019/posts/Hf14ubowVdL) photographer [Trey Ratcliff](http://www.stuckincustoms.com) discribes a neat way to have ones Google+ pictures displayed on a nice black background, sorted by "Most popular". Using your 21-digit Google+ ID as part of the URL

you will get something like [this](http://www.googleplussuomi.com/thumbs.php?id=105237212888595777019) (at least if you are someone like Trey). In my case the [result](http://www.googleplussuomi.com/thumbs.php?id=100581156331078830632) is considerably less spectacular, but I guess for now the most importaant bit is to know about the possibility to have your pictures dispayed in such a way.
