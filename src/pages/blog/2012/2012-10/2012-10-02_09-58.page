Now [this](http://www.nightwish.com/en/news#2187) is an interesting development:

> Another chapter of the [Nightwish](http://www.nightwish.com) story has ended today. Nightwish and Anette Olzon have decided to part company, in mutual understanding, for the good of all parties involved.
>
> In recent times it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover.
>
> Nightwish has no intention of cancelling any upcoming shows, and as a result we have decided to bring in a substitute vocalist starting in Seattle 1.10.2012. Her name is Floor Jansen from The Netherlands (ex-After Forever, ReVamp), and she has graciously stepped in to help us complete the Imaginaerum world tour.

I guess this is something a number of peope would have liked to see way earlier, but... An important detail to point out is that Floor has been cast as "substitute vocalist", which is not the same as a permanent band member. I am pretty sure that after the split with original singer Tarja, Floor was one of the names floating around as a candidate for the position, but as we all know things headed into a different direction. With _After Forever_ disbanded however I guess there will be ample speculations regarding a permanent engagement.
