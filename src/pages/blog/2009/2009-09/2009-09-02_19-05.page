Looks like some basic progress was possible to achieve faster than anticipated. Using the latest adjustments to the source code I now managed to get working builds on at least three platforms (two more pending, as the build is still running). One of the most important bits is or course that not only I am able to build on the new post-processing cluster in Groningen

but also the test program for the Python bindings works:

The main untested issue now is how everything will work on one of the newer 64 bit Intel Macs; since I do not have such a machine at my disposal, I am waiting for people to test the current version of the DAL and send me the results.
