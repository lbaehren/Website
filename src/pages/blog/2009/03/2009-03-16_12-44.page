Interesting piece of news coming in through the mailing list of [Rusty Cage Records](http://www.rustycagerecords.com):

> "Point of no Return" is Izegrim's wake-up call to the world, introducing the new line-up with 3 brand new songs and a re-recorded version of Angel of Demise (taken from our sold out album "Guidelines for Genocide"). And once again, they are on the move. Greater and greater numbers will be exposed to their raging torrent of thundering thrash, and the subversion has only just begun...

> We have made this album available for you to [DOWNLOAD FOR FREE!](http://www.rustycagerecords.com/label/content/view/1188/417) (23 Mb zip file), including all artwork. Be sure to grab this change, for it's a limited time offer between March 14th and March 31st!

Ok, this might not be my cup of tea music-wise, but I kind of like the folks, so I am looking forward to see them in concert and take pictures.
