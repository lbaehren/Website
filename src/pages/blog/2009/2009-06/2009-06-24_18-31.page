Ok, this is definitely not **Zwolle** anymore... Starting up the Laptop I ran into a problem I already encountered this morning. For some reason I still have to figure out, the track-pad on my MacBook Pro does hardly react at all when the Battery is inserted; it looks as though the battery limits the movability of the pad's surface, which signifies that the pressure sensor underneath is not getting activated. I was a bit stunned this morning when encountering this for the first time (which on the other hand kind of limits the time-window during which something must have happened); no matter how much I was pounding on the pad, the mouse-pointer would not act accordingly. As a first measure therefore I removed the battery and started the laptop on external power only; with the battery bay completely empty there was not problem anymore using both track-pad and mouse button as supposed to be. Luckily enough most of the time I am working with external keyboard and mouse, so the issue did not really slow me down during the day -- on the train now however this really is annoying.

As probably mentioned on a number of occasions this week was labeled another "TBB Busy Week", i.e. a week dedicated to things to work for the proposed LOFAR cosmic rays observation modes. Similar to the last time I was not involved in most of the activities directly, but more joining in from the side-lines. As (to some degree) was foreseeable I have been spending most of my time on getting coordinates-related issues sorted out; as we need to make some progress on the definition of the LOFAR image format getting the coordinate information cleaned up is vital. Turns out however that this a continued source of discussion, since we seem to have different angles of approach colliding in this one; whereas Ken (who was supposed to be the driving force behind getting things done) seems to be thinking very much along the lines of the FITS format, I am aiming for something more general and up-to-date (we are not in the 70th anymore and we do have other mass-storage media but tape drives...). So in order to make things more clearer I have doing quite some editing on the ICD (Interface Design Document) describing the internal structure of a LOFAR sky image data-set. To support this I also have been trying to put some example files down on disk, which turned into a slightly larger coding session (as I am hating this quick-hack jobs...); as a result of this since yesterday I have been writing three new C++ classes plus the same number of test programs -- a bit more as originally intended to get the job done, but it only seemed logical and now also provides others with the software tools to continue working.
