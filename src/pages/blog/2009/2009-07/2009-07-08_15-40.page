Looks like the upgraded version of my `updates` script is working now. After the latest changes this morning the computer has not stopped compiling packages ever since. If you just have a look at the list of packages to get installed, it may not seem too long:

~~~~
## ensure minimally required packages are installed
echo "-- Checking installation of basic set of Fink packages ..."
fink install blitz
fink install fftw3
fink install gnuplot
fink install gsl
fink install gv
fink install imagemagick
fink install latex2html
fink install nedit
fink install svn svn-client
fink install tetex
fink install tree
fink install unrar
fink install wget
~~~~

On the other hand of course almost all of the packages come with their own set of dependencies, such that even a single item expands into quite an impressive list of packages which need to be processed. What of course easily can take up several hours is if there is a specific compiler version which needs to be installed; as for that matter I think the laptop spent a considerable fraction of last night working itself through building and installing GCC 4.3.3 -- which resulted in the slightly insane hour at which I left the office to head back home (the Sun already started coming up when I turned the key). On the other hand -- if this exercise works well -- I am pretty certain to have the bits and pieces in places to go for a complete reinstall from scratch... using the maximum amount of automization possible right now.
