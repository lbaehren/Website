Since I briefly started touching the status where [[2009-07-08_09-53|my Drobo would suggest adding further storage capacity]], I now placed the order for a second one. Since first generation Drobos are no longer around I am getting a second generation one -- which also means I am getting improved transfer speed due to the additional firewire connection. As a consequence of this I will migrate the transfer-speed critical data -- such as movies -- to the new machine, whereas my photography archive will remain on the first machine. As for now I have ordered tewo 1 TB drives, which should be ok to start with; I did check though on the 1.5 TB drives, but they are still considerably more expensive in EUR/GB -- however if this changes, I do have all the flexibility to upgrade my storage later on.

While the first Drobo I was able to pick up by simply walking into the [[http://www.wifimedia.eu|store in Arnhem]], this time it will take 2--3 to get all the ordered parts together...  which is not big of a deal, since I am not too much in a hurry right now. I guess I will either be receiving an email or a phone call when everything is available in the shop. With this I am now also heading towards the final step to phase out all the older external USB drives, which (at least for my taste) took up too much space and power connectors.
