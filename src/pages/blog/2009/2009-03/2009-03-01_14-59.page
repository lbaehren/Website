Yes, there quite a few things I had on my list for doing today...

* Start working with the recently obtained Nikon SDKs and see if there is a way to use them outside the framework of the provided Xcode projects (rather would like to have more control, so CMake would be the obvious solution).
* Try to solve some of the pending problems with the recently committed beta-version of the CR-Tool imager.
* (Given decent weather) Leave the house and try to do a bit of photography.
* Follow up on the various Podcasts, such as _This Week in Photography_, _Seminars on Long-Term Thinking_ or _The Image Doctors_.

However it seems like a considerable fraction of the day will rather be spend on starting into the 4th season of "The Pretender". Why? Simple question: because season three closed with a cliff-hanger which is just way too good not to be followed upon. Since I did not want to the spend the whole night sitting at the desk, I copied the last three episodes onto laptop before crawling under the warm blankets; watching however had to be delayed until this morning, as I simply was too tired. Turned out, that this maybe was not too bad at all, because the last few episodes are part of a larger story ark, which would be hard to interrupt (one of the main reasons I rather watch series as this one from DVD -- or something else -- but on the TV). While the last two episodes of season three already by their title indicated that there was something bigger going on, the finish of the season really is one of the high-points of the whole show so far. Of course the ending is constructed such that there is not way delaying the continuation longer as anyhow necessary... which is why all further activities for the rest of the day have been put on hold, such that I can go into season four right-away (ok, I need to grab a little bit to eat, but otherwise that's it).
