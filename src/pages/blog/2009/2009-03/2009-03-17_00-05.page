What a series. Over the last two-and-a-half days I have been spending quite a few hours trying to keep up with the movies I still had on my list:

* [X-Men - The last Stand](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994)
* [Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726)
* [Star Trek: Insurrection](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120844)
* [The Notebook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280)
* [Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134)
* [City of Ember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411)

Besides this also on Sunday I finally managed to complete the fourth -- and thereby final -- season of [The Pretender](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115320). How many hours in total this sums up to I do not have the slightest idea, but it must be quite a few.

[X-Men - The last Stand](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376994) was a logical choice for the start into the weekend; after already watching parts one and two it was pretty clear I had to complete the series of movies. Though I never have been too much into the whole Marvel universe, this is quite decent entertainment -- something for the big screen and large audiences. Of course there is the valid question whether or not just adding mutants with more and more abilities is enough to create a story, but on the other hand the movies never attempt to claim being a character-driven piece of narration. This is not to say there aren't a few good actors around -- however they only will be able to do as much as their role will allow.

[The Wrath of Khan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726) and [Insurrection](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120844) finished off the series of Star Trek motion pictures; even though I did not go through them completely adhering to chronological order, by now I managed to watch all the ten of of them. Not too big a fan of the original series -- more in favor of the later installation such as _The Next Generation_ and _Enterprise_ -- I have to say that the motion pictures featuring Kirk and Co. are better accessible but the TV show; the overall atmosphere is more serious, less fixed on the quirks of the individual cast members.

[The Notebook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280) apparently is something Catalina pointed out to me last year; for some reason I must either have forgotten about that, but anyway I came across the movie by browsing through a collection of trailers. Having the copy around for a while I finally took the leap and watched it. Have to say that this is a beautifully photographed and narrated romantic story.

Quite s while ago I had been buying a larger set of older Science-Fiction movies, amongst them [Solar Crisis](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100649), the story of a mission to the Sun to reignite it when its energy output is winding down before its time. In some way [Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134) seems to be a remake of the older release -- bigger production, up-to-date visual effects, tighter pacing. The nice thing about the movie is however, that -- despite my fears -- it does take its time to work with the characters in it; a considerable portion of the story is indeed about the interaction of the crew against the backdrop of its critical mission.

Last in line was tonight's [City of Ember](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411) -- on my list for a while, after coming across the trailer. What I really love is the presentation of the city itself, its various areas and the people living in it: in fact this is the part on which the movie is spending most of its time -- after a very brief exposition regarding the actual creation of the city we directly dive into everyday life in Ember. The only thing which left me slightly disappointed was how little screen-time was dedicated to the efforts of finding a way out of the city and making it back to the surface; given all the story-wise preparations I would have hoped for something more but the rather smooth boot-trip through underground tunnels and lakes.
