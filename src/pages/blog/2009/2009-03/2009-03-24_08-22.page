After digging through some of the pictures taken last year, I picked up some more of the impressions from the trip to Romania. As usually done with most of the [pictures I am putting up on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren), I was trying to add a geo-tag -- a feature with nicely enables browsing pictures by geographic location. Turns out however, that [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) has quite a few holes in the mesh covering the surface of the Earth. Even though I had not expected to find a full street-plan of all the places I have been visiting, I was hoping to at least find a low resolution map of regions.

As can be seen from the screenhot above, Yahoo failed to fullfil my expectations. Of the many pictures I have been taking during our stay in Sinaia I was expecting at least to find a crude map of the area, which would allow to distinguish the settlement from its surroundings -- thereby allowing to roughly locate the castle outside the town. Romania however appears to be uncharted territory to quite some extend: the above view already was zoomed out quite a bit to get at least something more but a single line -- further zooming in will only result in an empty white area with no features at all.

Possible strategies?

* Try to tag the images as best as possbible (which might not be too good given the standards I am used to when placing pictures on a map of the Netherlands).
* Get a GPS receiver to in the future record geographic locations and store this information directly as part of the picture's metadata.

In both cases the hope would be that once one would start to populate these still uncharted areas, attention would be drawn to the fact that the maps need some improvement; as long as nobody is placing pictures there, why bother about it...
