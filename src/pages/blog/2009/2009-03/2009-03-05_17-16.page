If this is the case, you might be getting more done as opposed to the case were you simply would be sitting in front of you desk smiling all the time. Thanks to [Catalina](http://www.beeki.org) for pointing me to a short [news item on BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1386484.stm):

> Unhappy in your work?
>
> Well that's exactly how your boss will want it from now on, according to new research from Canada.
> Psychologists from the University of Alberta found miserable people make better workers than happy ones.
>
> Cheerful people waste too much time trying to maintain their happy mood, while their dour co-workers simply get on with the task in hand, the project found.
>
> The findings put a question mark over the millions spent each year on ensuring a happy working environment. 

As already pointed out to Catalina, I could easily image a correlation between negative mood and self-inflicted work-load. Not hard to imagine that lots of work indeed can be considered as means towards suppressing personal problems -- so instead of dealing what is going wrong inside of yourself you rather keep yourself busy and thereby distracted.
