After hearing about this for a number of times by now, I decided it was about time for me to have a look into the possibilities to get access to the internals of the camera RAW files produced by my Nikon DSLRs. The latest bit which made me go for this came from the weekly photography podcast [TWIP](http://twipphoto.com) (This Week in Photography) of which I have become a regular follower by now. Though I picked this up earlier already, I constantly was having the feeling that Nikon would not run a very open policy regarding the control of their camera and the data format of their NEF files; however episode #67 made it sound like there might be a slight change towards Nikon opening up a bit towards the more technically inclined user base -- reason enough to finally check out what is available. Only took me a minute to find [Nikon's SDK website](https://sdk.nikonimaging.com/apply); getting one of the SDKs however turned out more cumbersome as I was expecting from the description in the podcast. Turns out you not simply can download some piece of software, but you actually need to apply and sign up for it. After this tedious procedure I finally arrived at a page which offered me the selected SDKs for download:

Ok, I do not have a D3 (yet), but I was thinking it might not hurt to have a look at what was being offered in case you really wanted to code you own applications to control the camera from remote. The most interesting bit for the start of course is the NEF SDK, since this should allow me to write programs to access the information stored in the RAW files written out by my cameras. Right now I am busy printing the documentation and getting an idea on how to work with what is made available -- as soon as this phase is over I will attempt to actually code against the SDK library... progress will be reported here, so stay tuned ;-)
