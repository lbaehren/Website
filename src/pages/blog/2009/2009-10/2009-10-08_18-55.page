After a flurry of activities in September, the first hot phase of writing up ideas and plans for observations with LOFAR has come to an end. Begin of the week Rene, in his position as director of the Radio Observatory, has sent around the following statement:

> It may be interesting for you to know that the first 94 observing proposals for LOFAR have been received; at 2 A.M. on Thursday 1 October, the first submission deadline passed.
> Astronomers were asked to send in plans to participate in a collective commissioning plan that will be carried out in the coming half year to one year, and from which we already expect first science results. For this, as many as 59 proposals have been received.
> Astronomers were also asked to detail in advance their bigger plans for the somewhat further future. In this category, as many as 35 proposals were submitted. In this way we will take stock of the technical hurdles and questions, the possible science overlaps, and the oversubscription rate. Feedback will undoubtedly lead to proposals that are more attuned to the possibilities when we start up the full-sclae operational use of LOFAR next year.
> It is already clear that the proposals together ask for far more observing than we will ever be able to realise in the coming year. While that implies a significant challenge for the proposal review, it is also a new and very positive signal about the interest amongst astronomers in LOFAR!

What of course needs to follow next is that the proposals get evaluated and rated; this will require some time, but it will be interesting to see what the reactions will be, when first results from the review process are made public.
