Guess it is kind of official now: Mike Garrett sent around an email yesterday, als presenting some figures on what has been going on during the past weekend.

> This weekend more than 7500 people visited the astronomy weekend held at NEMO, as part of the overall International Year of Astronomy celebrations. ASTRON was highly visible throughout the proceedings, especially as our staff were kitted out in "ASTRON Crew" t-shirts (and caps), specially produced for the event. Hanny van Arkel was also an honourary member of the ASTRON crew this weekend. At the closing of the event on Sunday evening, Prof. Paul Groot (chairman of the Ned. Astronomy Club), publicly paid special tribute to ASTRON's contribution.

As for me I was around of course to take some pictures from the event...

The first approx. 100 pictures are online already on [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren/sets/72157616271683602|Flickr]], so you definitely should go there if you'd like to see more. Light conditions were quite tricky throughout the building, but nevertheless (I think) I managed to capture a few usable impressions of what was going on; more will become available as soon as I have been doing a little bit of editing and correcting.
