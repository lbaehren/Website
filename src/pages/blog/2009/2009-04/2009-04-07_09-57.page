It just happened again: ViewNX crashed on me while exporting RAW pictures to JPEG. Based on the experience from the past weekend I would have to say that this is happening way to often for my taste. Not that I have been dsoing something fancy of out of the ordinary:

  - Start up ViewNX.
  - Select the folder containing the pictures to work with.
  - Enable selection based on numbered tags, only showing pictures scheduled for further editing.
  - Add caption text to the EXIF description field of two pictures.
  - Select both pictures and enter Export  to JPEG.
 
ViewNX crashed even while writing the temporary file for the first picture! This can't be good and I sure can understand Michael's frustration with this behaviour. As for me I think it is time to get involved with one of the discussion boards at Nikonians, to raise a voice in this matter.
