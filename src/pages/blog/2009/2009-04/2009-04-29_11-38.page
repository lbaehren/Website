Here is a little something I stumbled across this morning:

Turns out this picture is part of the [Official White House Photostream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse) on Flickr. As can be seen, Obama might be one of the most powerful politicians on the planet, but he is not really a photographer: he is holding an DSLR just the way one would be holding a pocket camera and -- at least by first impression -- he seems not too comfortable with using a viewfinder.

A bit more "presidential" (if you will) might be this picture:

The currently available picture set documents the first 100 days in office, mainly from behind the scenes (which makes it all the more interesting). What a great job and opportunity this must be to be able as a photographer to have this sort of access.
