It has been mentioned in various meetings throughout this year so far -- now the announcement really is out:

> [LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org) is a revolutionary new telescope that opens up largely unexplored windows to the worldâ€™s astronomical community, by covering the radio frequency ranges 10-90 MHz and 110-250 MHz with unprecedented sensitivity and angular, spectral, and temporal resolution. It is a highly flexible, all-electronic telescope of phased-array antenna stations, making use of powerful (super)computer processing and (partially Grid-based) data storage facilities. LOFAR has synthesis imaging modes as well as all-sky transient monitoring and event buffering capabilities; station beam data can also be used separately or in coherent and incoherent combinations. LOFAR will carry out large surveys and allow significant use of archival data. Further information on its capabilities is available [online](http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/technical-information/lofar-technical-information).
>
> LOFAR will be operated by the [Radio Observatory of ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/radio-observatory) as a common-user observatory. The LOFAR collaboration involves consortia in The Netherlands and several other European countries. Teams of astronomers are working with the staff at ASTRON to ensure that LOFAR is optimally built to address a number of important and broad research areas, called Key-Science-Projects (described [online](http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/commissioning-projects/commissioning-projects)). These require the implementation of a number of specific observing modes and processing pipelines (described [online](http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/users/technical-information/major-observing-modes/major-observing-mode)), that in turn will allow a wide range of related and unrelated astronomical research projects to be undertaken.
>
> The coordinated commissioning phase, which requires expert involvement, is starting now (description [online](http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/astronomers/commissioning/commisioning-plan)). Subsequent science operations, anticipated to kick off in the latter half of 2010, will involve a mixture of reserved access shares and gradually increasing Open Skies.

Given the progress in the roll-out of the telescope hardware, the efforts in getting the required software in place and the required commissioning activities in sight, this now is the official invitation for access to put all the components of the system to a test.
