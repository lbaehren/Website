# Blog | {title:} #

Starting to write a blog was project that grew out of the need "to keep folks at
home in the loop". When moving to the Netherlands in [2004](/blog/2004.html), I was
trying to keep family and friends up to date on my where-abouts, then bigger and
smaller events while working at the [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl) institute and
taking up the exploration of the Netherlands. It only took a short while to
realize that sending around a bunch of emails wasn't going to cut it -- hence I
moved to a solution with greater flexibility for me in assembling contents (as
well as archiving it) and more flexibility for others to tune in and out.

<%
  a = { '01'=>'Jan', '02'=>'Feb', '03'=>'Mar', '04'=>'Apr', '05'=>'May', '06'=>'Jun' }
  mNum=['01','02','03','04','05','06','07','08','09','10','11','12']
  mName=['Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec']
  for varYear in 2004..DateTime.now.year
  varOutput=" - **#{varYear}** \:"
  for n in 0..11
    varFilename="src/pages/blog/#{varYear}/#{mNum[n]}/index.page"
    if File.file?(varFilename) then
      varOutput+=" [#{mName[n]}](/blog/#{varYear}/#{mNum[n]}/index.html) \\|"
    else
      varOutput+=" #{mName[n]} \\|"
    end
  end
%>
<%= varOutput %>
<% end %>
