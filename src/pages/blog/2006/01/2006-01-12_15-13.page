Verdammt, da habe ich tierisch gepennt:

> This afternoon, 15:00 - 16:00, gridpioneer Carl Kesselman will give a colloquium on his view on the past and future of the Grid. 
>
> With Ian Forster, Carl presented a new vision on distributed computing in the book "The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure." For a long time he was head of the Globus project, implementing the essential infrastructure for the Grid. He is now Director of the Center for Grid Technologies in the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (see http:www.isi.edu/~carl) . 
>
> As part of the Grid Physics Network (GriPhyN) project, Carl and his team are developing new techniques for managing and analyzing extremely large data sets, primarily for fundamental physics projects (CMS, [CERN](http://www.cern.ch), LIGO). 
>
> Recently, Carl has been working on ways to use grid technology for modelling the geophysics behind earthquakes. The Center for Grid Technologies also set up the EESgrid, whose goal is to provide better access to a range of earthquake engineering test facilities and data. 
>
> Carl today received an "eredoctoraat" at the University of Amsterdam and gives a ISOC/Gridforum Masterclass on Grid technology earlier this week. 
>
> We are very happy that we was willing to come over to Dwingeloo to bring us up to date on his Grid related research and his views on the future of Grids for science, including astronomy.

Super, weil ich Depp dies noch nicht in meinem elektronischen Kalender eingetragen hatte, habe ich mir genau fuer halb vier die Vorbesprechung fuer die Niederlaendisch Kurse aufgehalst. Das ist natuerlich die schlechteste Variante ueberhaupt, weil ich so garantiert keine Chance habe, mir irgendwie ausreichend etwas von dem Vortrag anzutun. Sehr, sehr aergerlich.
