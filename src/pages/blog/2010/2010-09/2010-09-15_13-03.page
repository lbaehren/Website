Wow, da hat Ralph endlich geschafft die Ausschreibung fuer die Stellen rauszugeben, so dass ich auch in offizieller Weise darauf regaieren kann:

> Applications are invited for 5 PhD students, 3 postdoctoral fellows, and 1 astronomical software developer to work on the AARTFAAC project. AARTFAAC is a project to extend the LOFAR radio telescope with an all-sky monitor operating in the 30-80MHz band, funded through an ERC Advanced Investigator Grant to prof. Wijers (University of Amsterdam), and to exploit both LOFAR and this extension to study extreme radio transients observationally and theoretically. It will be executed jointly by the University of Amsterdam and ASTRON Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. The project aims to open up new discovery space for very rare transient sources by imaging all the sky, all the time, and to break new ground in the realm of fast, near-real time wide field radio imaging. The research work ranges from developing fast radio data processing techniques to radio survey science and multi-wavelength followup work of selected transients, to theoretical modeling of the extreme astrophysical sources we will observe. Successful applicants will work at the University of Amsterdam or ASTRON, and collaborate widely within the LOFAR community.

> The software developer, one postdoc, and two PhD students should start in October 2010 or very soon thereafter; two further postdocs and three PhD students will start in the autumn of 2011, but the timing of all positions is somewhat flexible depending on the availability of suitable candidates. All candidates should be able and willing to collaborate closely in a team. Candidates for the PhD positions should have a Master's degree in astronomy or equivalent, or in computational science with a strong affinity for (astro)physical applications of their work; they should send a CV, statement of motivation, transcript, and 2-3 letters of recommendation to the address below. Candidates for the postdoctoral positions should have a PhD in astronomy (or in a related field with a strong affinity for astronomy); they should send a CV, research and motivation statement, and 3 letters of recommendation the address below. Candidates for the developer position should have a strong track record in scientific software development and a strong affinity with the science described above; they should send their CV, a research and motivation statement, and 3 letters of recommendation to the address below.

Ok, da muss ich mal schauen, dass ich die entsprechenden Dokumente eingeschickt kriege.; die CV habe ich ja schon fertiggestellt, so dass ich mich noch um die Empfehlungsbriefe kuemmern muss.
