It has been a while now, the [one of my Drobos has been indicating a shortage of storage](/blog/2010/06/2010-06-19_10-10.html); since in the meantime I have continued collecting data, the remaining disk-space has continued to shrink, such that I am approaching 90% usage. Therefore it now is time to get another, bigger drive, which I can swap in to replace to full one. Going with the trend I am this time opting for a 1 TB drive, a _2000GB Western Digital WD20EARS GP_; as the smaller WD models have served me well so far, I am inclined to simply pick a slightly bigger brother to increase storage capacity.
