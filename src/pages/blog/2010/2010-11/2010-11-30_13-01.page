Here is a little something I have been picking up form the latest edition of [State of the Union](http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/state.of.the.union) from past weekend:

> CNN's Candy Crowley talks to White House photographer Pete Souza, who records history 1/500th of a second at a time.

At some point in the past I already had been running into the [White House photostream on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse), which holds quite a number of amazing shots. Now the most recent edition of //State of the Union// provides another very interesting angle on the whole matter -- you definitely should check out the [footage on the CNN website](http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2010/11/28/sotu.souza.full.int.cnn.html).
