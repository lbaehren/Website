If a) you happen to be in the market for a rather exlusive medium-format camera and b) are planning to break the bank, then this might be just the investment for you:

> Hasselblad has announced a 100-unit limited edition of its H4D-40 medium format camera in stainless steel. The company has also said the H4D Ferrari limited edition, announced at Photokina 2010, is now available at retail prices of â‚¬21,499 and $29,499. The Ferrari edition comes with the company's 80mm lens, a special case and the Phocus image editing software. It is limited to 499 units.

[As reported by dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/news/1011/10112605h4dferrarishipping.asp) this special release is taking place in "response to photographer requests after seeing the solid steel body around which all H4Ds are built at photokina". My guess however is, that us mere mortals the choice would be between paying rent the next few years or getting this camera...
