For reasons unknown, the Geotagger Pro GPS unit remained with a frozen display since late last night. Picking it up this morning I noticed, that I would show the time information only, but without updating it. Furthermore at normal operation a little //GPS// logo would be blinking in the upper left corner of the display -- this was not the case any more.

Looking for a way to reset the GPS unit, I have been trying any possible combinations of the control buttons -- with no effect at all. Disconnecting and then reconnecting the charging cable showed no effect at all. Therefore slowly running out of options (and ideas) I took this the //GPS Geotagging// on Flickr:

> Here is a little trouble I have been running into: since last night the display of the Geotagger Pro is completely frozen and the unit will not respond to pressing any combination of buttons. I have been looking all around for information on how to perform a hard reset of the unit, but neither in the Users Manual nor online I have been able to find help. Does anybody around here have an idea what to do?

However I am not expecting too much, as a previous post did not cause any response at all.
