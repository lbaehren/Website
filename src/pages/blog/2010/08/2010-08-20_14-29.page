It's been bugging me a number of times by now, that when working with the
default compiler on my Mac, things would behave in a different way, than using
the [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org). Lately however I have started to miss certain
features, which would be required in order to perform certain code development
on my laptop. The most recent even was the the lacking support for OpenMP, which
apparently only is available with newer versions than installed on the system by
default:

~~~~
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)
~~~~

Therefore I have now started to get a straight installation of a recent GCC
release onto my system. Not to go completely bleeding edge I yesterday tried to
install version 4.4.4, which unfortunately failed. Given the error messages I am
not entirely sure, where the problem is, but one of the possibilities is that
trying to build a recent version of GCC with a slightly older version of Apples
GCC is not too good an idea. Therefore I now have decided to work my way up the
GCC ladder, hopefully leaving me with a working installation at some point.
