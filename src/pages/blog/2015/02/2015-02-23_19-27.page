## {title:} ##

Hard to over-estimate the impact the migration to [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) as
(local) version control management tool has had. Given the fact that I am spending
a considerable fraction of my time traveling on the train, still being able to commit
source code changes (and revert changes if need be) is quite essential.

The above would not be possible if I would be doing a straight SVN checkout of the
original [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) repository -- using ``git-svn``
provides me with the additional comfort layer and security layer, which enables me
to continue working while traveling.

Probably the only (considerably small) draw-back of this setup is, that it works
quite well, making it harder to find some motivation and use case for testing other
tools, such as e.g. [Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki)
which every since listening to the [episode on FLOSS-Weekly](http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/320)
is high up on my list of software tools to play with).
