Given the number of adjustments to the machinery behind this website -- mainly the
helper scripts and some of the directory structure -- taking a closer look at the
contents hosted on the server seemed like a good idea. As it turns out there has been
quite a lot of contents, which probably should not even have ended up there in the
first place: I noticed quite a number of temporary files (probably the result of failed
page generation runs) and directories which no longer should be present. Since the
synchronization of local (build) version and the version hosted on the server is done
via `rsync` I had a look at the exact configuration of that transfer:

~~~~ cmake
    add_custom_target (online
        COMMAND ${RSYNC_EXECUTABLE} -axuzP ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/out/* ${PROJECT_UPLOAD_PATH}
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
        COMMENT "Publishing website - uploading generated pages ..."
        )
~~~~

While the command in itself is not wrong -- otherwise I would have trouble even
transfering the data -- one rather important bit was missing: without the additional
`--delete` option files will accumulate on the webserver, taking up unnecessary
space and potentially causing faulty navigation through the website. The remedy
for this is quite simple:

~~~~ cmake
    add_custom_target (online
        COMMAND ${RSYNC_EXECUTABLE} -axuzP --delete ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/out/* ${PROJECT_UPLOAD_PATH}
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
        COMMENT "Publishing website - uploading generated pages ..."
        )
~~~~

Switching on the `--delete` option for `rsync` in fact causes a clean-up of the
target directories:
