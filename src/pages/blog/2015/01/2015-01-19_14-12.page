As far as I am concerned I have not seen any (desktop) version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)
where this feature works properly:

My expectation would be that when afterwards rebooting into a newly installed system
running

~~~~ bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
~~~~

should not lead to any further package updates. The contrary is the case: even
before I manage to open up a terminal window to type in the above commands, the
"Software Updater" pops up to announce there are several updates available -- not
the kind of behaviour I would expect when checking the corresponding box earlier in
the process.
