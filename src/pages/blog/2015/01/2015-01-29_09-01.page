Here is a litle something I have been working on last night: after struggling with
parts of the [Webgen](http://webgen.gettalong.org) configuration for the generation
of my website, I adjusted a) the path at which the configuration file would be place
by [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) and b) the location from which the `webgen` executable
would be called. As it turns out the can make quite a difference: the initial impression
after a few re-generations of the pages is, that things run faster now (though it still
takes a while to go through a few thousand source files).

One of the relevant changes has been to no longer place the generated Webgen configuration
file inside the build directory,

~~~~ cmake
    configure_file (
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/webgen.config.in
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/webgen.config
        )
~~~~

but instead putting it into the root-level directory:

~~~~ cmake
    configure_file (
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/webgen.config.in
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/webgen.config
        )
~~~~

With this adjustment out of the way, the website generation can be run from the
standard location (i.e. in the same way this would happen when using Webgen to create
the base-structure for a new site):

~~~~ cmake
    add_custom_target (Website ALL
        COMMAND ${WEBGEN_EXECUTABLE} generate
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
        COMMENT "Rendering website from sources ..."
        )
~~~~

The side-effect of this -- something of course I was trying to avoid with the
out-of-source build in the first place -- is that some changes are made to the
source directory. Luckily the only thing actually happening is that Webgen will
create a number of files within the root directory of the project -- adding these
files to the `clean` target will help to put back everything into its original state.

~~~~ cmake
    set_property (DIRECTORY
        APPEND PROPERTY ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
        ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/webgen.cache
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/webgen.config
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/config.yaml
        )
~~~~
