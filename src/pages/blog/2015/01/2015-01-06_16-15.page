With the growing amount of data/information coming in from the OCAL measurements,
a good argument can be made in favour of keeping interfaces to that data clean and
easily usable. One thing to be considered part of this is small webpage I have been
setting up to provide an overview of the available diagnostics plots:

Pages such as the one above were quite common -- trying to cover all possible combinations
of measurement type and diagnostic plots there typically only is a subset for which
viable information exists. In order to avoid bloating the webpages, making it harder
to find what actually is available, a simple filter has been added to the Bash script
generating the intermediate files (from which [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) then
generates the actual HTML pages):

~~~~ bash
    nofQuicklooks=`find_nof_files $1 $2 ${varQuicklook}`
    # only create link if there is some contents to link to
    if [[ ${nofQuicklooks} -ne 0 ]] ; then
        echo " - \subpage ${varAnchor}  (${nofQuicklooks} files)"
    fi
~~~~

A very simple measure, but quite effective -- with this getting around to the actually
available diagnostics plots becomes more straight forward (and links are added the moment
the corresponding data arrive).
