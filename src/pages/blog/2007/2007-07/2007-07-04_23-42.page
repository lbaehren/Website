... there is no turning back. Yes, it is only since Sunday evening, since I have been working with the 23 inch Cinema Display on my office desk, but this already has been enough to make me go for the same type of equipment to be set up at home. Late this afternoon I already was through most of the steps ordering the monitor -- the only thing stopping me was, that I wasn't 100% sure about the mail address of the astronomy department, where I wanted the package to be send to (sending it to my home address didn't seem like a good idea, since I am hardly there). Not so long ago Sven mentioned the Apple Education program, which offers a 10% reduction on almost any type of hardware -- even including iPods! So what I did was checking out the price for a 23 inch Cinema Display, which turned out even less than some of the camera lenses I am currently looking for. Reason enough not to put the decision on the bench, but to directly go ahead. I got until the final page of the order, where I needed to fill in the delivery address, but then noticed, that I wasn't really sure about the address; however this could be resolved on the way out (where I had a quick look at some of the letters in the mailbox), such that I can go ahead tomorrow. If everything works just fine, the monitor should be here next week.

So why actually spending this additional money on some new monitor? If it were just for the total working-space, then the virtual desktops would be fine; already now I am typically using at least three or four of them to organize and group the various applications running on all the machines I am working on (which typically is three: the Laptop, Ray,  dop71). However there are certain activities which considerably gain from increased display area on the screen:

This screenshot shows the kind of typical arrangement of windows I now have adopted for working in Nijmegen: the xterms on the left-hand side give access to all of the before-mentioned computers, thereby allowing my to keep the overview of what's going on there. Central point for working is the editor window -- that's where all the coding is taking place. Parallel to this the two additional terminals on the right are used for compiling, updating and documentation generation. The same layout won't translate onto the standard 15 inch screen of the laptop -- so if I want to avoid reorganizing each and every time I am getting from the institute to home, the only viable option is to double the periphery.
