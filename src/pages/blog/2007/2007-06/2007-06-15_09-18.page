All the things needs to happen for the first time at some point. Such today I alsmost forgot part of my luggage when stepping out of the train in **Zwolle**; turns out that the combination of still not being fully awake but already trying to slove coding problems is not very much in support of keeping your thoughts with the here and now. Fortunately I noticed the mistake just before walking out of the door, such that I was able to rush back and grab the bag, which most preciously contained the camera. So this was close...

The actual updates concern matters in Nijmegen. The first news is, that after vanishing without any announcement the Monday last week Andreas Horneffer has send in a short message that he is still amongst the living and is going to make a reappearance next week:

> I'm sorry for all the troubles I may or may not have caused by not being around.
>
> Physically I'm well, but I just couldn't get myself to get out of bed. (And no, I would prefer not to talk about it...)
>
> I'll be back on Monday, hopefully in a better mood than last week...
Of course this statement leaves quite some room for speculation, which I guess is already taking place by now. What now actually was behind his disappearing act we still won't know for a while. However I would think that I should not be too much of a problem to at least let people know if you need some days off; I guess no one would be forcing someone to come to work if he/she is not capable of it -- but a short note definitely would be fine.

The other news is, that appearantly the issue with the display has been settled; Cisca sent me an email yesterday stating that there were no objections any more, such that the order could be send away:

> Misschien wist je het al maar Paul heeft het door jouw gekozen computerscherm goedgekeurd. Nu kan ik het dus gaan bestellen.

I definitely consider this a positive development, though I for sure like to find out, what has been happning in the meantime. Paul was walking around on Tuesday, checking on people's computer equipment, paying especial attention to monitors. If this now means there will be an overall upgrade for the complete department I don't know (though it would not hurt). If indeed there was some fear I was asking for hardware rather distinct from what everyone else has, I something I really would have to verify. Another possibility of course also might be, that Heino has been bringing this up, after being at ASTRON in Wednesday, and there getting to here of the possible struggle with getting me some reasonable working equipment. A number of questions, so I really am curious to find out more about it.
