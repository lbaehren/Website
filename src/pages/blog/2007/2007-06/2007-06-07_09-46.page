... state, that a new entry is to be created whenever passing through **Zwolle**. Though I am no longer sure at which point this had been established as some sort of tradition, this has been the procedure ever since (e.g. Corina might be able to tell a tale of this from our joint trips to Amsterdam). Since I got the PowerBook I think there is only a single occasion, when I missed writing: at this year's Queensday I was traveling without the Laptop (but camera instead), such that there was no way to properly produce an entry when the time was at hand. The rules furthermore state, that entries here at **Zwolle** are kind of a snapshot of whatever is happening recently; this might be a comment on something which has taken place the day before or speculations and expectation regarding a shortly upcoming event.

As for today I think I'll restrict myself to mention, that indeed I have taken up again the task of doing some literature search on (preferably tomographic) imaging; given the nature of the problem to reconstruct the spatio-temporal-spectral properties of the radio emission from a cosmic ray air shower of a lightning discharge, deconvolution of the generated image become an even bigger issue as is the case of interferometric imaging in standard astronomical applications; from closer inspection of the problem at hand, in fact we are dealing with a multidimensional inversion problem which most properly would be solved by a ray-tracing type of approach. There is a Monte-Carlo code developed by Tim Huege (REAS / REAS2) which computes the electric field as received by the antennas from particle shower distribution via propagation of Maxwell's equations; in some sense this is the only precise way to relate the evolution of the partcle shower with the radio signal. The hook unfortunately is that there exists no direct inversion (i.e. to go from the electric fields as detected by the antennas to the electric field generated by the particles in the shower), such that one might be tempted to try some kind of template fitting technique; but since this would require a massive library of simulated air shower events this is hardly a realistic method either. Enter tomographic imaging with phased arrays. The fact that the multiple antennas provide multiple viewing angles towards the volume of interest, strongly relates the problem to what is done in e.g. medical or geophysical imaging; so beside exploring capabilities and limits of the Measurement Equation formalism, a literature search on who this problem is approached in othere fields should yield some important information and help to guiding a way towards the method imaging radio emission from cosmic rays and lightning discharges. From the few papers I printed out yesterday I already got some ideas, which I will follow up parallel to completing the reimplementation of the Skymapper.
