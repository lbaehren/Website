I guess it realy is true what they say: storage is cheap. When I was in the city yesterday I dropped in one of the computer shops close to the city center. Have past this place a number of times I already had seen the add offering a 500 GB LaCie external USB 2.0 hard-drive for 100 Euro. Considering that for the previously purchase 320 GB version I payed approx. 120 Euro, this seemed like a bargain. So without too much hesitation I just went into the shop and got one drive right of the shelf. The interesting point of this is of course that this just feels like ordinary shopping -- I think the total time for purchasing the drive was the same as going out to buy my standard portions of tea. The nice thing now is, that below my desk there are three drives -- I now officially have crosed the 1 TB limit! Furthermore I already started thinking if it actually wouldn't make sense to buy at least another one and then set two 500 GB drives up as RAID -- something reasonable to do, especially considering the need to enhance the duration of my ever-growing archive of digital pictures (which continue coming in at considerable rate -- given I have completely switched to shooting RAW).
