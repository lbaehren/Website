Given that sometimes there appear to exist different schools regarding the creation and significance of documentation, since years I have come to follow my very own approach; this means that I almost whatever notes I keep from the things I do, this information enters public domain (or at least is accessable by the people for which the notes may be of value at some point). Even though this is an approach which I have been using since studying days -- insider might remember the _Scientology digest_ or later the beloved _Advanced Laboratory Course Online Archive_ -- this tradition has been kept and even intensified with taking up the original position at ASTRON. The at that point rather non-existent documentation for the LOPES-Tools packages quickly exploded after discovering and introducing Doxygen; that fact that minor tweaking would allow not only to treat in-code documentation (e.g. of programs or interfaces of classes), but also to handle whole tutorials was soon to be adopted by the LOFAR Software Engineering Group (nevertheless I was quicker). After Brett Deaton spend the summer at ASTRON, working together with Heino and me (actually more with me, since Heino was away most of the time... some things never change), through him Wikipedia and therewith the whole Wiki-concept was brought to my attention. The whole idea of an open-access online encyclopedia was very appealing, so it was only a matter of little time before basing my webpages at ASTRON on a Wiki (for historical reasons it really might be interesting to find out, if someone else had been experimenting with this before or if I indeed was the first one to use this to archive personal information). Even before the idea of creating a LOFAR Wiki began circulating seriously, my private Wiki already had accumulated not only an extended documentation for the LOPES-Tools, but also included a whole section on the LOFAR Initial Test Station (ITS).

Since Bytes are cheap and easy to store (even in large amounts), I hardly have been throwing away any web-site data I ever created (I usually have complete backups lying around somewhere). Because of this, yesterday's event could be handled with some grace: shortly before lunch Wim van Cappellen showed up in my office and started asking me a number of details regarding the computer infrastructure of the original ITS installation. After being deconstructed begin of this year, the backend electronics of ITS have become part of the DIGESTIF experiment, currently under construction at the Westerbork telescope. So the main questions things started to converge on was: would I know how to get everything up and running (do some troubleshooting) and might I be given the time to actually help if required (the latter was rather amusing for me, since I never have been part of the school, that I needed a boss to control each every minute of my working day, such only doing things which previously got the official ok -- a concept many people at ASTRON appear to have ingested with the coffee they drink). According to Wim's information I had been preparing a number of notes at the time, while Stefan, Michiel and I were the only people really using ITS -- so were these notes still available and potentially of help to solve some of the problems at hand? Answer one: yes the notes still exist. Answer two: when rebulding my website I did not include everything from the old version. Answer three: give me five minutes and all the documentation is back online for everyone to read. Given the fact, that Wim did not show up asking a certain type of questions make me conclude that indeed a considerable fraction of what he was looking for was covered by the Wiki entries I have been compiling when I was working in the subject myself. 

I guess this only once again supports my point of view, namely that documentation not only adds value to a project, but sometimes even may be essential. I knwo that there is a lot of thinking along the lines of though that it is of more importance to first e.g. finish coding before thinking of documenting; this approach however bears the risk, that at that point some of the background information for certain decisions in the process are no longer present and thereby considerably limit the understanding of why things came to end up the way they did. And is documentation really such a lot of effort? I don't think so. If you need to keep notes on what your are doing, the overhead to put this into a form which later on will be usable by other is only little overhead. Ok, in case you are planning to write something e.g. like a User's Guide or a tutorial, this might require a bit more time; but documenting your code our keeping track of a sequence of shell commands is not big a deal.
