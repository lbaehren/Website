The usual stop here in **Zwolle** is the perfect opportunity for another small background story from Nijmegen. Memory is still fresh concerning the issue of ordering new computer hardware, to finally get me some reasonable equipment which will be at my disposal both in Nijmegen and in Dwingeloo. As I hadn't been following up the issue as I originally intended, once Cisca mentioned the order had been given ok status, today finally I approached Paul on the subject, hoping to gain some insight on what made him change his mind. Given the circumstances it wasn't a hard thing to guess, that something must have been happening behind the scenes, after Michael brought this subject up with Heino (and even Joerg, just having started at Nijmegen, paying attention). Not pushing this issue, but simply being curious, I dropped by Paul's office and mentioned that it had come to my ears he was having some reservations against my order for computer equipment and that I was wondering what had made him change his mind. The first answer to that already was an evading one, along the lines that yes there had been some discussion with Heino and the order now had been signed off as I presented it. Given this clue it was perfectly clear, that this needed some more explanation. However Paul turned out to be everything but eager to elaborate, reducing it to the statement "There are certain things I don't think you will need to know about in full detail." So whatever it is, that took place after last week's ARC meeting, I do not think it was too pretty, because it was fairly obvious that Paul was very uncomfortable talking about it. So the net effect is: I will get the equipment I have picked. The remaining undercurrent however is, that the inner workings as they take place in Nijmegen need to be watched carefully; this time it worked out positively for me, but this might not always be the case. To a considerable degree this is, what has made taking up a rather skeptical position towards the place: the suspicion that you can never really afford to let your guard down.
