Oh weh, jetzt ist es mehr oder weniger offiziell:

> Subject: Jupiter VLBI Experiment ...
> 
> Yesterday night we had our first attempt at a joint Nancay-LOFAR ITS VLBI experiment on predicted Jupiter bursts.
>
> Surprisingly, it did not fail because of technical issues, but because Jupiter did not cooperate.
>
> In a last-minute attempt Klaas Jan Wierenga had made important modes available that were crucial for the experiment to succeed in the first place and Lars BÃ¤hren successfuly got ITS to operate despite a number of ITS PCs dropping out. We now have 3.35 sec look-back capability and can store 6.7 secs of data from all 60 antennas (all-sky, all Frequences, 60 Gb) in a few minutes (5-10) and be operational again. This greatly improves our duty cycle.
>
> Around 9pm we were ready (with 1 hour delay), continuously recording with ITS on the TIM boards, and our fingers on the trigger button, awaiting a phone call from Nancay telling us about Jupiter activity. The French were sitting in front of a real-time display to detect any activity on Jupiter and ready to record themselves. However, Jupiter was in a quiet phase as it was in the last couple of weeks. So, the telephone didn't ring.

> We will trys again in a few days. Our French colleagues used the idle time to improve their prediction. They claim to have found yesterday that high-frequency emission (>30 MHz), if it occurs, follows very deterministic patterns, allowing almost 100% predcitions and the possibility to observe during day time (despite the RFI at low frequencies). So, we will try again....
