... which since the end of April this year actually can happen here in the Netherlands, traffic might get redirected or even partially blocked. Even though the royal couple won't be visiting [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl) itself, their trip to the nearby Dwingeloo seems to be enough to impare travel along local access roads:

> On Tuesday May 28 King Willem Alexander and Queen Maxima will visit Dwingeloo. This means that the access roads to Dwingeloo will be temporarily unavailable or partly closed between 6.00 - 16.00 hours. We have checked with the townhall and the Oude Hoogeveensedijk 4 is accessible. However, there will be several checkpoints where you need to state that you are going to ASTRON.

The only other events I can remember the roads being blocked would either be the big celebration in Lhee (somewhere in the fall) and the chaos after a storm (when access roads are getting blocked by fallen trees).
