This is so great: I just stumbled across [this entry on Google+](https://plus.google.com/100347151288200087365/posts/G7Ya3mLADxc) from them makers of the [Omagetau Podcast](http://omegataupodcast.net):

> In January I will visit Arjen Anthony Lucassen (aka Ayreon) to talk about his music and the technology involved in creating and recording it. If you have questions I should ask them, please send them ASAP.

So what this means is that somewhen begin of next year -- yep, 2014 is coming up fast -- there will be an episode with Arjen on the recording technology behind the [Ayreon](http://www.ayreon.com) albums.
