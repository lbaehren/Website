Following last week's [article on Heise News concerning web browser statistics](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Browser-Statistik-Chrome-laeuft-allen-davon-1912193.html), I decided to take Google's [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome) for a slightly more serious test drive this week. While time and again I had been looking into [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US) alternatives, most of these times I had been using browsers in kind of a parallel mode, where _Firefox_ was still selected as the default browser. As a result of this, whenever clicking on a link (e.g. in an email), I would be ending up with two web browsers running. Therefore in order to do some realistic everyday testing, I now changed the settings, switching off Firefox for the week... let's see how this is going to work out.
