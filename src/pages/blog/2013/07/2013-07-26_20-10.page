This is a little something which has been bugging me for quite a while now: for a long time I have been wanting to change the local homepage used for the web-browsers on my computer, moving it from manually written HTML code to something generated from a more simple markup syntax. Given the fact that [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) for a while now has been supporting [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as a syntax (which I also have been using for some of the extended documentation for the TROPOMI SWIR calibration software), the decision was rather easy. Finally now this week I have been taking little while of an evening to make the necessary changes, setting up the overall (infra-)structure and filling in the basic contents.

While the starting page still contains quite a bit of HTML in order to get the multi-column layout (which simply makes the page contents more compact and thereby avoid the need to scroll), the remainder of the pages is basically straight-forward Markup:

Naturally the whole process of generating the HTML output from the source files is driven by [CMake](http://www.cmake.org); this way not only pages can be generated on the fly (e.g. by scanning other directories or inspecting system characteristics), but also all of the usual features of a normal software build are available (such as and out-of-source build and installation of the generated files).

One of the things you may ask is: why all of this in the first place? Very simple. Given the fact that I tend to work with various web browers -- sometimes out of the need to be able to access certain pages, sometimes out of interest to test an alternative program -- using bookmarks does not seem like a good idea. Keeping information in a transportable format, which also can be moved across platforms, without a minimum of overhead hence seems like the way to go.
