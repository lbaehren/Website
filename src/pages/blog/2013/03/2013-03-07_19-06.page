Whatever I have been doing wrong the first time around, apparently my new attempt to refactor some of the code going into the library for SWIR calibration is coming along nicely: only shortly before leaving my office at [SRON](http://www.sron.nl) I pushed online a set of changes.

All of this of course still needs to be pushed back to the main repository -- which will be done through a pull request on [Github](http://www.github.com) -- but in terms of data structures (and associated manipulation functions) I am now at 60% of the way: the two remaining structures to be extracted are `s4_dataset` and `s4_group` -- with a little bit of luck I even might be able to complete this on the train back home.
