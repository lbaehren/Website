I got back a few minutes ago, after taking a detour to the [Rotslab](http://www.rotslab), where I have been attenting a special evening two weeks ago. After sending in the pictures I made that evening, I wanted to pick up on the idea I had earlier, namely to also photograph the interior of the lab in HDR. While due to work I was not able to attend this afternoon's activities, I at least left early enough to still encounter some of the organizers. From the feedback I have been getting, they seem to have liked the pictures I have been sending in, such that getting access to the lab wasn't a problem. Amazingly enough I all in all I have been spending almost an hour taking various pictures inside the place, bracketing 9 exposures in steps of 1 EV between -4 EV and +4 EV (which is the maximum the camera will allow me to do in normal operation). Now back home I am of course curious to see the outcome: the files already have been copied onto the computer, basic keywording has been done and now I have started processing...
