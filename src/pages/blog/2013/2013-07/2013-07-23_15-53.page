Here is yet another thing which makes me wanna scream:

~~~~ c
      C does not support default arguments
                                  hid_t fid=0);
~~~~

Not only am I not able to overload functions, but as well I am not able to write something like

~~~~ c
void swir_data_h5_show_metatable (struct swir_data_mtbl_rec *mtbl,
                                  hid_t fid=0);
~~~~

Would somebody please explain to me, why this apparently is so much better then e.g. C++ ?
