... as presented by [DreamWorks](http://www.dreamworksanimation.com):

> In partnership with the [Council on Competitiveness](http://www.compete.org), Dreamworks produced a short animated film on the importance of high performance computing to the U.S. economy.

I a recent [post on Google+](https://plus.google.com/107363503261150463012/posts/W9W3Tcmu8bw) engineer and recording artist [Antonis Karalis](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107363503261150463012/about) pointed out this short-film, employing [The Penguins of Madagascar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Penguins_of_Madagascar) as main characters to present the applications and relevance of High Performance Computing (HPC). Nice point to bring the whole thing around of course is, that the short film itself has been made using HPC.
