With the past few days working at [SRON](http://www.sron.nl), today I am running operations from the desk at home in Bonn. Given the fact that we managed to set up the VPN connection right away on Monday, at least from the basic technical point of view there is no difference between working from the office or from home (short only the direct access to printers in the institute).
