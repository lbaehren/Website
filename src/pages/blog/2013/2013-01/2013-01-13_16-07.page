Entnommen ist dies dies der Folge fuenf der HBO Serie [The Newsroom](http://www.hbo.com/the-newsroom), welche ich diese Woche fuer mich entdeckt habe.

> The Newsroom is an American drama television series created and principally written by Aaron Sorkin that premiered on HBO on June 24, 2012. The series chronicles the behind-the-scenes events at the fictional Atlantis Cable News (ACN) channel. It features an ensemble cast including Jeff Daniels as anchor Will McAvoy, who, together with his staff set out to put on a news show "in the face of corporate and commercial obstacles and their own personal entanglements."
