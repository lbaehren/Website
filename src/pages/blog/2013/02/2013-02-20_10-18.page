Now this is what I call a real telephoto monster:

> The [AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/singlefocal/Telephoto/af-s_800mmf_56g_fl_ed_vr/index.htm) offers the longest focal length of 800 mm in the history of NIKKOR autofocus (AF) lenses, as well as a maximum aperture of f/5.6. Adoption of two fluorite and two ED lens elements has resulted in excellent rendering with effective reduction of chromatic aberration, superior resolution, and high contrast. In addition, Nano Crystal Coat makes for clear, consistent rendering with incredible ghost and flare suppression. When the teleconverter is used with this super-telephoto lens, the electromagnetic aperture enables stable exposure (AE) with high-speed continuous shooting. The lens is also equipped with a vibration reduction (VR) mechanism offering performance equal to an increase in shutter speed of 4.0 steps*. This new lens enables certain capture of the perfect moment for professional sports and press photographers, as well as advanced amateurs who enjoy photographing birds and wildlife.

I picked up the news about the release this morning from an article on [Heise Foto](http://www.heise.de/foto/meldung/Neue-Nikon-Optiken-17-000-Euro-Supertele-und-ein-Weitwinkel-Zoom-1793543.html), which also mentioned a preliminary prize for the lens: 17.130 Euro. Deals allowing to e.g. trade in you car in exchange for the lens are not known at this point in time ;-)
