Damn right it did! I am having a hard time remembering when last a version of the [Opera](http://www.opera.com) we browser would work on my macBook Pro. Not that it crashes somewhen during surfing websites -- it does not even start up and crashes pretty much right away.

So as much as I would like to have Opera as an alternate web browser, it is not usable at all at this point in time.

Of course I had a look at the error log, which was produced; but as to be suspected the application is pretty much self-contained, not relying on too many system-dependencies; amongst the latter of course there are parts of the general system infrastructure, but this is nothing which would get affected (at least I would hope so) when running an number of packages from [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org).
