Yes, I know this must be a typo, but just the thought of it sets off a number of ideas:

> Later today Avid confirmed the closure of DS on a conference call, “Since 2008-2209 we have tried to move people towards Avid DS but the business just hasn’t been there.” Users were not happy of course.

In yesterdays quick take [Eyeon seeks ex AVID DS users](http://www.fxguide.com/quicktakes/eyeon-seeks-ex-avid-ds-users) __fxguide__ co-founder Mike Seymour sheds some light on community discussion around the assumed 
[Avid DS](http://www.avid.com/en/products/avid-DS) end of life. If the name [Avid](http://www.avid.com) does not ring a bell with you, and __Avid DS__ is something you've never heared of, then this might be helpful:

> Avid DS is a full-featured editing, graphics creation, color correction, and compositing solution, and is the absolute best conforming tool for Media Composer and Symphony to create and deliver high-end content.

Already sent in a short message via the "Contact us" page to point out the typo.
