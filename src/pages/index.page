# Welcome #

... the web-presence of Lars B&auml;hren. Hopefully the collection of pages you
are looking at will give you some idea of my activities in the following areas:

### Education & Research ###

After finishing my university studies at [Bonn University](http://www.uni-bonn.de)
mid-2003 I very much was interested in continuing research in the area of
astro-physics, more specifically in radio-interferometry. The opportunity presented
itself in the form of a junior-researcher position at [ASTRON](http://www.astron.nl),
the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. The institute just had received
major funding for the development and commissioning of the Low Frequency Array
([LOFAR](http://www.lofar.org)), a novel radio telescope to be constructed within
the Netherlands, with outriggers across other european countries.

My main involvement has been with the High-Energy Cosmic Rays Key Science Project,
based at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Whereas the main goal of our scientific
analysis is geared towards the understanding of the radio from extensive cosmic
ray air-showers, the incoming data almost are saturated with all sorts of signals
-- be they of natural or human-made origin; one of the topics I have been working
is the detection of radio signatures from electric discharges (lightnings) in
thunderstorms.

### Computing ###

Between January 2004 and October 2010 my work has been focussing on the development
of software for the scientific analysis of the data taken with the LOFAR telescope.
During the first phase of that period my primary interest has been in the imaging
of the radio intensity distribution as emitted by cosmic ray air-shower -- but
also as originating from lightning discharges in thunderstorms. The novel
capabilities of “digital radio-telescopes” -- the usage of large numbers of cheap
receptor elements combined with high-performance computing -- allows to explore
physical processes in unprecedented ways.

### Photography ###

It is now already some years since I picked up my first SLR; as a regular visitor of the Rheinkultur festival I developed some interest in the photography of musicians and their audience. Finally moving to digital at the end of 2006 I have decided to get a bit more serious about photography – not only spending more time going out and using the camera, but also investing in good equipment to enable shooting under available light conditions.

This site mainly hosts some technical and background information – if you want to have a look at the pictures themselves, feel free to drop in on [my Flickr pages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren).
