### Computing ###

Between January 2004 and October 2010 my work has been focussing on the development
of software for the scientific analysis of the data taken with the LOFAR telescope.
During the first phase of that period my primary interest has been in the imaging
of the radio intensity distribution as emitted by cosmic ray air-shower -- but
also as originating from lightning discharges in thunderstorms. The novel
capabilities of “digital radio-telescopes” -- the usage of large numbers of cheap
receptor elements combined with high-performance computing -- allows to explore
physical processes in unprecedented ways.

### Photography ###

It is now already some years since I picked up my first SLR; as a regular
visitor of the Rheinkultur festival I developed some interest in the photography
of musicians and their audience. Finally moving to digital at the end of 2006 I
have decided to get a bit more serious about photography -- not only spending
more time going out and using the camera, but also investing in good equipment
to enable shooting under available light conditions.

This site mainly hosts some technical and background information -- if you want
to have a look at the pictures themselves, feel free to drop in on [my Flickr
pages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/larsbaehren).
