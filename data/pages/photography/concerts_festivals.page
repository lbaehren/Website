### Eggfest 2009

_06 Jun 2009, Eibergen, Netherlands_

While everyone already has his/her eyes on the big open-air festival of the summer – such as e.g. the Graspop Metal Meeting or the Wacken Open Air – there are of course quite a number of smaller festivals all over the country. It was through Izegrim that I took notice of the Eggfest, a small but very nice festival in the town of Eibergen. Hard to find on the map, it however turned out worth the travel, as the festival provides a very relaxed atmosphere where music fans an musicians can interact. Noteworthy is the fact, that the festival takes place at the Eibergen Open-Air Theater, a nice located between border of the city and the river – plans are under way to renovate the location, which would make it all the more interesting to visit in the future. 

### ProgPower Europe 2008

_03.-05. Oct 2008, Baarlo, Netherlands_

The 10th edition in total – the first one for me – featured [Pagan's Mind](http://www.pagansmind.com), Cynic and [Threshold](http://www.thresh.net) as headliners. Held at the Sjiwa in Baarlo, the festival brought together an international cast of bands and fans; or a number of the bands this was their first trip to Europe ever – so yes, there were quite a number of specials. Limiting the total number of participants – bands, fans, press, etc. – to approx. 500 persons, resulted in a very related atmosphere, which left ample room for conversations and meetings. While I already had seen Threshold and Cynic live on stage earlier this year, most of the other bands were either completely new to me or on the “still have to see” list. 

### Cat-Rock Festival 2008

_Sat, 16 Aug 2008, Emlichheim, Germany_

With two weeks rest from the W:O:A it was time to pack up gear and head out for the next open-air festival. Cat-Rock was held at Emlichheim (DE), just a few kilometers into Germany and reasonably well to reach by bike from the nearest train station on the dutch side. The festival started at 10:00 h in the morning and ran until somewhat after midnight. Playing as opening act were the friends from Non-Divine (who also originally pointed me to the event), followed by a number of bands I either had never heard of before or was aware of only vaguely by name. Exciting for me of course was possibility to have another encounter with swedish power-metal heroes Sabaton; sadly enough their set had to be cut down by at least 10 minutes due to some hick-up in the overall schedule.

### Wacken Open Air Festival 2008

_Thu, 31 Jul – Sat, 02 Aug 2008, Wacken, Germany_

Just when I thought that the Graspop Metal Meeting was impressive... The Wacken Open Air is of a scale which is hard to believe and explain to a person who has not been there and seen it. Wacken – a small municipality near the city of Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, with approx. 2000 inhabitants – for the extended weekend once more has been taken over by literally tens of thousands of metal fans from all over the world.

One of the biggest obstacles this time (as compared the GMM) was the fact that the access to the photographers pit was handled very restrictively; as a consequence all the pictures had to be taken from some vantage point in the audience, signifying a considerably larger distance to the artists on stage and a constant struggle with someone getting into the line of sight.

### Rheinkultur 2008 

_05 June 2008, Rheinaue, Bonn, Germany_

Another splendid issue, the 26th, of the open-air festival with free entrance and a wide variety of music: Ben Folds, The Futureheads, Anti-Flag, Sportfreunde Stiller, Air Traffic, Tomte, Schandmaul, Blackmail, ... Except for the evening the weather was just great, just the thing for an open-air festival; on the other hand long-time visitors of the festival know how to prepare, so the weather most likely is not going to be the all-deciding factor. After years of of taking pictures just for fund and for myself, this year I received an accreditation through Heavy Metal Magazine, such that bringing along all the photography gear was no problem at all.

### Graspop Metal Meeting 2008 

_27.-29. June 2008, Dessel, Belgium_

Three days outside with a few thousand metal fans to see acts such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica, Whitesnake, Iced Earth, Yngwie Malmsteen & a lot more; check out the festival website for further details. This was my first big assignment for the Heavy Metal Magazin, covering both most of the concerts as well providing material on the festival ground as such. Had a lot of fun and came back with almost 3500 exposed frames. A great experience, especially working side by side with a number of people who do this for a living; turns out we all have our problems when it comes to getting usable pictures under opposing circumstances.
