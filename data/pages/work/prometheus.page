## prometheus digital image archive

prometheus is an internet-based service ([www.prometheus-bildarchiv.de](http://www.prometheus-bildarchiv.de)) for artistic and cultural research comprising a publicy accessible area as well as an access restricted, fee-based one. The service is presented by the Association of the same name in cooperation with the University of Cologne. prometheus charges users a license fee which is solely used to make the service available.

The prometheus image archive is a data broker which brings together heterogeneous and distributed image and media databases from a variety of sources. These databases are made available at no cost by public as well as private institutions for non-commercial research and teaching purposes.

User license fees are for administration costs incurred by the University of Cologne in running and expanding the service, and are not based on copyright fees associated with the images and media files themselves.

### Project history 

[prometheus – The Distributed Digital Image Archive for Research and Studies](http://www.prometheus-bildarchiv.de) started on April 1, 2001 as a cooperative
project in Germany. Within the frame work of New Media in Education, prometheus
was supported by the [Federal Ministry for Education and
Research](http://www.bmbf.de) (bmb+f) with a total amount of 1.8 Mio. €. The project’s executing
organization “New Media in Education” was associated with the
[German Institute for Aerospace industry](http://www.dlr.de) (DLR).

During the 3 years of the project’s development and implementation, the project team consisted of 9 project managers, and a total of 50 staff members and assistants from 4 universities and 8 institutes. From the very beginning of the project, the established objective was to encourage close interdisciplinary interaction to enable all staff members to gain an understanding of varied subject areas, and to participate in decision making.
