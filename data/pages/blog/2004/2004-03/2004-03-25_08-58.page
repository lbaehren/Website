Und so schnell kann es gehen; kaum ist die Version 1.0 fertig gibt es auch schon die erste Revision:

Academic education I received at Bonn University, studying physics with astronomy as minor subject. To some good proportion this direction taken has been a continuation of interests held for a long time (still sticking out after all this years is Isaac Asimov's "The Black Holes", one of the first books I read when gaining access to thhe local library). While the focus in physics for a while shifted towards particle and accelerator physics the major major influence had been the theory lectures (electrodynamics, quantum theory). This in combination with the excellent lecture by Uli Klein on aperture synthesis in radio astronomy finally brought me to the topic of my diploma thesis: "A method for the extraction of relative magnification matrices from VLBI observations of gravitational lens systems". This work was carried out at the IAEF, supervised by Peter Schneider.
